<br>
Here's to a life of a broken fame (caught in the motions)<br>
You've been letting the world decide your fate<br>
A weak man, in a stronghold<br>
Consumed in all the things he needs<br>
But it's never enough<br>
It's never enough it seems<br>
<br>
Some may call it the high life<br>
But you took the easy way out<br>
You had your moment to shine<br>
But now it's wasted<br>
You've done nothing but waste it<br>
<br>
We've gotta find a way to show you how<br>
To pull these words from the pages<br>
To make this world your own<br>
<br>
These words, these words
They are the only ones that I come back to<br>
And with these hands<br>
We'll move the world just to find you<br>
<br>
You cannot find a way<br>
When all you do is aim to accumulate<br>
Reaching out for everything but the answers<br>
We have gone astray<br>
Here you are again<br>
Struggling to stand on your own two feet<br>
Why is this happening?<br>
Your ambitions have made you blind<br>
Just open up<br>
It's not too late<br>
<br>
We are the authors of our own demise<br>
Feeding greed will only leave us dead inside<br>
<br>
I stood my ground and I pushed you out<br>
But I still couldn't find<br>
What made me whole<br>
What broke the mold<br>
And without you<br>
I'll never know<br>
Without you I'll never know<br>
I'll never know<br>
I'll never know<br>
Without you I'll never know<br>
<br>
These words, these words<br>
They are the only ones that I come back to<br>
And with these hands<br>
We'll move the world just to find you<br>
These words, these words (just to find you)<br>
These words, these words (just to find you)<br>
And with these hands<br>
We'll move the world just to find you</p>

Why can't I just follow you?<br>
Oh God, it's taking over<br>
<br>
This is a takeover<br>
My eyes have learned to lust<br>
And my mind was molded to betray you<br>

Leads to nothing but pain<br>

Release yourself from the things that<br>
Hold these chains in place<br>

Release yourself and break away, break away<br>
Remove these chains from me<br>

Falling into my own extinction<br>

Forgotten innocence, just a shadow of who I was meant to become.<br>
Is this who I was meant to be?<br><br>
Why can't I save me?<br>
In pursuit of flesh, I was rotting in my own<br>
A broken soul, searching for home<br>
Alone and forsaken<br>
Take me back to the days when I was young<br>
Take me back to the days when I could feel anything<br>
Take me back to the days when I was young<br>
Take me back to the days, take me back<br>
to the days when I was not afraid to die<br><br>
Each and every star will fade,<br>
but every night brings a new day<br>
I can't see what's in front of me,<br>
oh help me find my way<br>
Seeing all the right and wrong,<br>
hoping that I will stay strong<br>
The fire in the sky will light my way back home<br>
What are we afraid of? The past is gone,<br>
leave it behind<br>
What are we afraid of? Resurrect the man who died inside<br>
Words can't bring back the way that we used to be<br>
We need guidance<br>
We need action<br><br>
When the road ahead looks bleak and the<br>
scars on our hearts have slowed our breathing<br>
Don't let the darkness define you,<br>
step out from the shadows<br>
Don't let the darkness define you,<br>
you are not alone<br>
Don't let the darkness define you,<br>
you will find your home<br>

Would you even care if my heart stopped beating, my heart stopped beating?<br>

But you did what you did once again<br>
I chose love in a moment of death<br>
And this is how you repay me?<br>
Ripping trust away<br>
I will let you rot, waste away<br>
Return to the ground for heaven's sake<br>
And now you will know my misery<br>

Burning within<br>
<br>
Destroy the madness<br>
Destroy the madness<br>
No one's voice will speak for me<br>
<br>
Every day we're growing colder<br>
Our divide is growing further and further<br>
The hands of time are moving faster<br>
When will we stop paying<br>
The price of agony?<br><br>

Holding on to what we know<br>
Too proud to change<br>
Too scared to grow<br>
Holding on to what we know<br>
Too proud to change<br>
Too scared to grow<br>
Holding on to what we know<br>
Too proud to change<br>
Too scared to grow<br>
Holding on to what we know<br>
Too proud to change<br>
Too scared to grow</p>

              <p class="lyrics-test-test">Light the match<br>
Set my body ablaze<br>
There's no more good to find when you find yourself in a cloudy haze<br>
Pressure pushes its way inside<br>
No room to move nowhere to hide<br>
Divide the strength within myself<br>
The way of life has pushed me to a living hell<br>
Endless misery, lack of sympathy<br>
I don't trust the voice inside of me<br>
<br>
I always put myself out there but it always ends the same<br>
If words are words then I'm the only one to blame<br>
Backbreaker<br>
Sever all the ties sever all the lies<br>
Backbreaker<br>
Reach inside and see if I'm living<br>

Light the match<br>

There's no more good to find when you find yourself in a cloudy haze<br>
Every good intention turns to dust<br>
Where do your loyalties lie when there's no one to trust<br>
<br>

Sever all the ties sever all the lies<br>
Backbreaker<br>
Reach inside and see if I'm living<br>

Every fear consuming<br>
Oh<br>
<br>
The world is watching<br>
Their eyes are piercing me now<br>
I feel the pressure<br>
This will be my end</p>

I keep it dark, let no one in<br>
Theres a heart somewhere in my chest<br>
Is there a beat? Does it exist?<br><br>

Will I ever feel anything<br>
Will I ever see the end of my story<br><br>

I'm so haunted by who I used to be<br>
A brighter version that I left behind<br>
Wasted my innocence<br>
Seeing anger with my open eyes<br><br>

Bring me back to a time where I didn't tear things down<br>
Bring me back to a life where I wasn't so let down<br><br>

Am I here to lose my way?<br>
Separate me from the sorrow<br>
Give me hope for another day<br>

I don't feel the same, I just feel ashamed<br><br>
