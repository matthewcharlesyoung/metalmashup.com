This is not what we were made for<br>
More, we were made for, we were made for more<br>
<br>
Can we accomplish the impossible<br>
And turn this around?<br>
Is it enough?<br>
Enough to break us out<br>
Of this prison we made<br>
Of this life that we hate<br>
We need to find a way<br>
A way to make a change<br>
So we're singing now<br>
<br>
Say it again, say it again<br>
I know this is not what we were made for<br>
Say it again, say it again<br>
I know we were made for<br>
We were made for more<br>
This is not what we were made for<br>
More, we were made for, we were made for more<br>
<br>
Take my mind, take my life<br>
And make it yours<br>
Mold me into something more<br>
Take my mind, take my life<br>
And make it yours<br>
Mold me into something more<br>
<br>
Something more<br>
<br>
Take my mind, take my life<br>
And make it yours<br>
Mold me into something more<br>
Take my mind, take my life<br>
And make it yours<br>
Mold me into something more<br>
<br>
Say it again, say it again<br>
I know this is not what we were made for<br>
Say it again, say it again<br>
I know we were made for<br>
We were made for more<br>
This is not what we were made for<br>
More, we were made for, we were made for more<br>
This is not what we were made for<br>

So wrapped up, I know it's wrong but I can't quit it<br>
I tried to hold my own<br>
This life is all I know<br>
My legs won't make it home<br>
The ground breaks where my feet fall<br>

It's the ugly side of me<br>
The part that you don't want to see<br>
And I can't separate myself<br>
From this hell im living<br>
I think I'm losing control<br>
I think I'm scared of letting go<br>
I know I'm living the lie<br>
It's time to take back my life<br>

It's all i think about<br>
Try to escape you're the only way out<br>
Hanging by a thread<br>
These chains are (a tired tread)?<br>

My head is the first to criticize<br>
While my heart's stuck fighting on the front lines<br>
