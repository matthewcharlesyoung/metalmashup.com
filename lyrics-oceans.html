      <p class="lyrics-test-test">Born and raised side by side<br>
Been closer than close our whole lives<br>
We share the same blood, same mother and mind<br>
But ended up so different, you and I<br>
<br>
You was always a brother to me<br>
Helped me out in times of need<br>
I would anchor down<br>
And weather the storms<br>
You would stand and fight to protect us<br>
This you had sworn<br>
<br>
Taste the blood of your brothers<br>
Draw blood<br>
If you fell down we would fall together<br>
Like a sinking ship in stormy weather<br>
You’re the bones to our flesh and skin<br>
But now that you’re gone<br>
It’s time to rethink without you<br>
Home is fractured and broken<br>
I’m still hoping for your safe return<br>
But you never looked back since you<br>
Took your first steps<br>
And mother still grieves over that<br>
Day you left, that day you left<br>
And mother still grieves, still grieves<br>
That day you left<br>
<br>
Draw blood<br>
Eliminate the weak<br>
You stray down the wrong path at night<br>
Trying to fight your own way in life<br>
Beaten black and blue from<br>
The eternal flight<br>
Side by side, you know<br>
Everything will be alright With you by my side<br>
Everything will be alright<br>
<br>
Taste the blood of your brothers<br>
Born and raised side by side<br>
Been closer than close our whole lives<br>
We share the same blood, same mother and mind<br>
But ended up so different, you and I<br>
<br>
You was always a brother to me<br>
Helped me out in times of need<br>
Raised me up for when you were gone<br>
Taught me to take no shit from anyone<br>
<br>
You was always a brother to me<br>

      <p class="lyrics-test-test">Get off your high horse and bow before me!<br>
Silver stairs to a castle so high,<br>
that from the tallest tower you could touch the<br>
sky<br>
On an island in an endless sea of sun<br>
The devil dances on the horizon<br>
With your head in the clouds,<br>
I guess it’s hard to hear the sound of a dying world<br>
Where pure evil courses through its veins<br>
We’re just a stain in your beautiful creation<br>
The poison to your apple<br>
We picked all those years ago<br>
We are the poison!<br><br>
You’re just a snake in the grass<br>
That always seems to slither<br>
right through the cracks unscathed<br>
But you have no one to save you now<br>
I am filled with rage!<br>
I am filled with hate…<br><br>
Your way with words is your only asset<br>
Wormed your way into every aspect of my life<br>
What makes you think I’d give up without a fight?<br>
Get off your high horse and bow before me<br>
Silver stairs to a castle so high,<br><br>
that from the tallest tower you could touch the<br>
sky (pretend to fly)<br>
On an island in an endless sea of sun<br>
The devil dances on the horizon</p>

Never heard the cries for help.<br>
I have no one to blame but myself.<br>
Whispers in the wind,<br>

They came to conquer,<br>
(They Came to conquer) Not for glory<br>

is to watch us crash and burn.<br>

Vultures above and sharks<br>

This killer instincts<br>

We are the creators of our own demise.<br>
They took to the sea’s.<br>
They took to the skies.<br>
Only had eyes for my prize possessions<br>
Turned all my confessions into lies.<br>
<br>
All they want is to watch us crash and burn.<br>
This is what it feels like to be in the jaws of defeat.<br>
One thousand teeth. Slowly sinking in.<br>

Reach out… the world is at your feet<br>
You can’t dwell on your feelings, in a city that never sleeps<br>
Stop dreaming<br>
Start believing in yourself<br>
Wake the fuck up, break through the walls<br>
Drop your fears<br>
Control was never lost, it’s always been here<br>
I’m walking on thin lines of broken glass every night<br>
You have no idea, you have no idea<br><br>
about all the fucked up shit that runs through my mind<br>
Keep your head up son and look on the bright side<br>
Stop weighing up the downsides of life and you’ll be just fine<br>
You’ll be just fine<br>
In this concrete jungle, you’ve got to fight to stay alive<br>
Burn bridges in order to survive<br>
Opportunity is your only ally,<br><br>
shut your mouth it’s your only alibi<br>
But the worst part about this is I can’t fully describe it<br>
These problems and issues - are not mine<br>
I can’t help you, it’s up to you<br>
Stop dreaming, start believing<br>
Show no weakness and hide your feelings<br>
I’m walking on thin lines of broken glass every night<br>
You have no idea, you have no idea<br><br>
bout all the fucked up shit that runs through my mind<br>
Keep your head up son and look on the bright side<br>
Stop weighing up the downsides of life and you’ll be just fine.<br>

Finding so little answers<br>
My friends told me to give up the ghost<br>
and move on<br>
But I don't like to take my chances<br>
to take my chances<br>
<br>
Pick me up off the floorboards<br>
I'm not dead and burried yet<br>
They always seem to creak<br>
When I needed someone to speak to<br>
They've been the only thing I've talked to in weeks<br>
Where were you<br>
Where were you?<br>
<br>
Stitch me up and make me new<br>
I need someone to pull me through<br>
Endless nights with open wounds<br>
I've been to hell and back because of you<br>
<br>
Why tell me I need to change?<br>
When you woke up in someone else's bed<br>
Without even knowing their name<br><br>
I may have crossed the line<br>
This Time!<br>
But I sure as hell hope you have a rope for this climb<br>
From here on out it's all a downward slope<br>
And I'm not falling for anyone or anything<br>
Othe than the noose you tied around my neck<br>
<br>
I've lost all sense of space and time<br>
Just thinking about when you were mine<br>
The days become weeks and the weeks into months<br>
I refuse to put on these implausible fronts<br>
To face the world would cause me to self destruct<br>
To face the world would cause me to self destruct<br>
The days become weeks and the weeks into months<br>
I refuse to put on these implausible fronts<br>
To face the world would cause me to self destruct<br>

They've been the only thing I've talked to in weeks<br>
Where were you<br>
Where were you?<br>
<br>
Picke me up (Up!) off the floorboards<br>
I'm not dead and buried yet<br>
So pick me up (Up!) off the floorboards<br>
I'm not dead and buried yet!

We would run between the lines and<br>

Painting by numbers, how hard could it be?<br>
Stole all the water colours from our dreams.<br>
Told me our future was all just make-believe.<br><br>
Ripped me open for my friends to see,<br>
destroyed my world and made me bleed.<br>
Lost the most beautiful thing I’d ever seen.<br>
You took my heart and painted it black,<br>
looking on the bright side is something<br>
I lack.<br>
You were all that I had.<br>
I lie in my room pulling out my own hair.<br>
It gives me something to do, but doesn’t get me anywhere.<br>
Not even time can repair<br>
the space the you left here in my chest.<br><br>
You linger in the air.<br>
So fuck the facts, you knew all along we’d never last.<br>

Your colours faded away unlike my feelings for you.</p>

Not with the people I want but the ones that I trusted.<br>
This is a toast, to make amends to all<br><br>

Apologies we had to leave, we thank you with open arms.<br>
You made us who we are.<br>
We’ll drink to this, through thick and thin.<br>
Lost in desire.<br>
Misdirected but never inspired.<br>
Even though we are miles apart,<br>

Through these years we’ll drift afar.<br>
My head will always be back at the start.<br><br>

Like a cancer it grows inside.<br>
You always had the god damn wit.<br>
With just a flick of the wrist, to pop the<br>

I’ll remember this to the end.<br><br>
You and your god damn wit pushed her over the edge.<br>
Contagious in every light, and I can’t stand the sight of myself.<br>
Living this life in skin I’m not worthy to wear.<br><br>
As memories fade, I can feel myself beginning to change.<br>
Even in my sleep there’s no escaping.<br>
Voices plot and plunder, they’re saturating<br>
my mind with words of wisdom.<br>
That destroy the world which I once calle<br>d my kingdom.<br>
With just a flick of the wrist.<br>

I saw the great white light and passed through to the other side.<br>
In a moment of madness when time stood still,<br>

I was never the saint, more like a sinner.<br>
But I knew my rights from all my wrongs.<br>
That living for the sake of loving,<br>
was where my heart always belonged.<br><br>
You’ll always have a place in my heart,<br>
even after death pulls us apart.<br><br>
I am the ghost that haunts this place.<br>
The cold that always touches your face.<br>
The thought that sends her weak at the knees.<br>

I’ll be the light to guide you from harm’s<br>
way and fight to keep your demons at bay.<br><br>
If you need me, just pray.<br>

to live a life in the dirt and the undergrowth.<br>
I cut all ties, severed myself from what they<br>
called “the real life”.<br>
Carved my path through stone, where am I now?<br>
No one knows.<br>
With new lungs to breathe and fresh eyes to see.<br>
I pity those too weak to not break free.<br><br>
Living their life on old ideologies,<br>
that have been passed down for centuries.<br>
Run free and see what you want to see.<br>
Get lost along the way…Break free.<br>
Forever searching for an open door.<br>
All I’ve known my whole life is how to run.<br>
Through distant lands and foreign shores.<br>
To escape has been my only thought.<br>
Raised by wolves into the wild.<br>
I am a son of the lost isles.<br>
Raised by wolves into the wild.<br>
I am a son of the lost isles.<br>
No rules, or religions.<br><br>
Just a free world and my own decisions.<br>
I’ve never been home…<br>
I don’t belong anywhere.<br>
I guess I’m homeless because home<br>
is where the heart is and I’ve never been home.<br>
Forever searching for an open door.<br>
All I’ve known my whole life is how to run.<br>
Through distant lands and foreign shores.<br><br>

I’m trying my hardest to forget.<br>
Not to let your face, mirage inside my head…<br>
Smile’s come few and far between…these days.<br>
I can overcome this, but the numbness,<br>
I’ve endured for so long.<br>
It’s hard to break the mould.<br>
I can barely keep my head above the waves;<br>
cus’ this hurt, it never fades.<br>
It never fades!<br><br>
I’ve endured this - for so long.<br>
This pain - never fades.<br>
A kaleidoscope of emotions, that changes with the wind.<br>
When will I be free again?<br>
This pain it never fades…<br>
What more, do you ask of me?<br>
I bear the scars and a broken heart on my sleeve,<br>
that’s so heavy I cannot breathe.<br>
So I beg you and I plea.<br>
Just let me go, just set me free - because the pain it never fades.

I can't expect you to forget<br>
You're moving mountains for me<br>
When all I do is bring you pain<br>
<br>
With open arms<br>
I shall accept my fall from grace<br>
With open arms<br>
I shall accept my fall from grace<br>
With open arms<br>
I shall accept my fall from grace<br>
With open arms<br>
I'll accept my fate<br>
I'll accept my fate<br>
<br>
I'm nothing but deadweight<br>
I'm nothing but deadweight<br>
<br>
Set ablaze like a wildfire<br>
The day our worlds collide<br>
I can't expect you to forget<br>
You're moving mountains for me<br>
When all I do is bring you pain<br>
All I ever do is bring you pain</p>

        <h1 id="s7" class="lyrics-test">-Entrapment-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Condemn these visions of clarity<br>
Vast glaciers they conceal reality<br>
I'm so sick of all the memories that haunt my mind<br>
Frost bitten but convince myself that I'll be fine<br>
This time it's gone too far<br>
This time it's gone too far<br>
<br>
This fragile cover can pull you under<br>
Please don't bury me<br>
Why can't I keep these thoughts from caving in<br>
Like an avalanche<br>
Like an avalanche<br>
<br>
All it takes is one little step<br>
To be the death of us<br>
<br>
So suffocate beneath this weight<br>
Entrapment<br>
Concealed so deep it's slowly killing me<br>
This emptiness in my head pulls me apart at the seams<br>
<br>
Purity let's slip to deception<br>
I'm caught beneath the ice searching for my reflection<br>
On step wrong move caused it all to shift<br>
A consequence but it don't mean shit<br>
<br>
Desolate<br>
Entrapment<br>
<br>
The recklessness has fallen silent<br>
But I never took you as one for violence<br>
The damage is already done<br>
You left me numb<br><br>

This fragile cover can pull you under<br>
Please don't bury me<br>
Why can't I keep these thoughts from caving in<br>
Like an avalanche<br>
Like an avalanche<br>
<br>
So tread lightly now the snow is weak<br>
I should have never gone so deep<br>
Take my hand<br>
Take my hand<br>
So pull me out of this avalanche</p>

        <h1 id="s8" class="lyrics-test">-Hikari-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Down foreign paths and uncharted shores<br>
The beauty lies within these wars<br>
Overcome the wilderness with countless failures<br>
For I'm not living just to exist<br>
<br>
I'm on the verge of discovering<br>
This person I'm meant to be<br>
I'm on the verge of discovering<br>
This person I'm meant to be<br>
I'm on the verge of discovering<br>
My calling<br>
<br>
Sometimes losing yourself is the only way back home<br>
Believe in me it's all you need<br>
True happiness is the greatest discovery<br>
<br>
Forget the ones who tell you how to feel<br>
It's crystal clear once you know it's real<br>
Been here all along right in front of you<br>
Stood in resounding opacity<br>
It's the greatest discovery
</p>

        <h1 id="s9" class="lyrics-test">-Birth-Marked-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Just a child<br>
Who longed to see you smile<br>
But you tore my heart apart<br>
And forced me into the wild<br>
Just a child<br>
Made to carry this burden<br>
Made to carry this burden<br>
<br>
Cast into darkness from the day I was born<br>
Crying out for help but beat to the floor<br>
You never loved me<br>
You never loved me<br>
<br>
Battered and broken<br>
Left stripped of emotion<br>
These wounds go far beyond skin deep (far beyond skin deep)<br>
What have you done to me<br>
What have you done to me<br>
Starved of the love I craved so desperately<br>
<br>
Hush little baby don't you say a fucking word<br>
You make my skin fucking crawl<br>
<br>
My innocence consumed by fear<br>
Drowning in waterfalls of tears<br>
Yet through a tyranny of words<br>
There's still love here<br>
Can't you see that there is still love here<br>
<br>
Battered and broken<br>
Left stripped of emotion<br>
These wounds go far beyond skin deep (far beyond skin deep)<br>
What have you done to me<br>
What have you done to me<br>
Starved of the love I craved so desperately<br>
<br>
Just a child<br>
The one that you defiled<br>
I bear the scars from my past<br>
A life that you had exiled<br>
Just a child<br>
Born condemned to rejection<br>
<br>
Waste away<br>
Though you gave me life you're fucking dead to me<br>
Waste away<br>
Waste away</p>

        <p class="lyrics-test-test">You're my enigma<br>
Why claim another life<br>
When you're still ruling<br>
A sea of corrupt minds<br>
Feed from my weakness<br>
(my weakness)<br>
I fear my hands are tied<br>
<br>
Afflicted over and over again<br>
<br>
This vicious cycle it eats me away<br>
The very soul of this person you lead astray<br>
<br>
Fighting this with every breath I breathe<br>
When the smoke fills up my lungs<br>
It's so hard it's just so hard to see what's underneath<br>
I lust for strength to just come clean or bite my tongue and let it bury me<br>
<br>
I know there's a hell 'cause you're keeping me here<br>
You're keeping me here<br>
You're keeping me here<br>

When the smoke fills up my lungs<br>
It's so hard just so hard to see what's underneath)<br>

        <p class="footer-text article-margin">Here at Metal Mashup you will find a site that celebrates all things heavy and metal. Yet in an effort to move away from the more mainstream aspects of our scene, Metal Mashup has a much-needed focus on the more underground achievements of our community. Don’t get us wrong though, while we all love a bit of Metallica and still lose our shit every time Hetfield sneezes or Lars manages to keep time, we just feel that there is more to our clan that needs to be celebrated.</p>
