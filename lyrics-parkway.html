Without movement, i can't escape<br>
Die<br><br>
Searching through the static<br>
Twisted and torn inside of<br>
Such blinding visions of destruction<br>
So i have to question<br><br>
Was this in the master plan?<br>
Now a broken future's all that we hold<br>
Broken<br><br>
Our broken future is all that we hold<br>
Our day draws<br>
To it's close<br>
Dusk<br>
Washes away<br><br>
Integrity now bleeds away<br>
As tired hearts are left to drain<br>
Do you see there faces when you fall asleep at night?<br>
Now they're nothing more than blood stained memories<br>
Blood stained memories</p>

Another night wasted wishing you away<br>
Now I'm cut, I'm cut at the wrist<br>
But i still can't kill the pain<br>
I'd give anything to rip you from my head<br>
From my head<br><br>
The return of your voice marks another failure<br>
And i can feel your blades closing on my back<br>
I'll savour this one last taste, this taste of sanity<br>
As it clutches, tearing at my heart<br>
This is my final act of desperation<br>
One second lost gives way to disease<br>
I'd give anything to rip you from my head<br><br>
Cause i can feel you<br>
Creeping through me<br>
Like a sickness<br>
Your weakness<br>
Scars your fucking face<br>
Scars your name<br><br>
The return of your voice<br>
Marks another failure<br>
And i can feel your blades<br>
Closing on my back<br>
As light fades to past<br><br>
Darkness wells against me<br>
But my shattered eyelids<br>
Refuse to close<br>
Your breathe is death to me</p>

And this world is bearing down again<br>
So hard to clear my mind<br>
Why do i persist?<br><br>
I'll endure another day<br>
It's just so hard to resist<br>
And I can't continue on<br>
So hard to clear my mind<br>
To see the thoughts I wish were true<br>
My face versus the stone<br><br>
And I blame myself<br>
Plague my mind with these insecure thoughts<br>
Whispers in the back of my head<br>
Telling me it's all wrong<br>
Why do I persist?<br><br>
I'll endure another day<br>
Why do I persist?<br>
As self loathing strangles me<br>
Push past the veil of helplessness<br>
Love can't catch me, not today<br>
Take your hand and just surrender?<br>
It's just not worth it<br><br>
Why do I persist?<br>
I'll endure another day<br>
Why do I persist?<br>
Self loathing strangles me<br>
But I'll endure another day</p>

So when did it come down to this<br>
Fashion victim<br>
Takes on a whole new meaning<br>
"It's just for fun..."<br><br>
Hey, I'm sure it is<br>
So tell me is that fun<br>
Convulsing on the door<br>
Open your eyes<br><br>
You're walking the path to your self destruction<br>
The higher you fly, the further you fall<br>
Harmless?<br>

How the fuck am I supposed to feel when<br>
everything I know lies broken at my feet?

            <h1 id="ff4" class="lyrics-test">-Wreckage-</h1>
            <p class="lyrics-test-test">I am the blackest soul.<br>
The child of a loveless world.<br>
The wreckage left in the wake of time.<br>
I am the consequence of complete collapse.<br>
I am the horror you created.<br>
The mind fuck you instigated.<br><br>
I am the seed of self-destruction, the bitter taste of life's regret.<br>
Flood my lungs.<br>
Pull my teeth.<br>
Cross my eyes until there's nothing left.<br>
There's nothing left.<br>
Casualties to the snares of modern life.<br>
Anchored by avarice, there is no further left to sink.<br>
I reside in my mind's eye, yet see no truth in a world of lies.<br>
I reside in my mind's eye.<br>
We are adrift in a world of lies.<br><br>
Flood my lungs.<br>
Pull my teeth.<br>
Cross my eyes until there's nothing left.<br>
I am the blackest soul.<br>
The child of a loveless world.<br>
I am the consequence of complete collapse.<br>
I am the blackest soul.</p>

            <p class="lyrics-test-test">This is survival.<br>
This is my exile.<br>
I find no solace.<br>
I find no solace beneath a Godless sky.<br>
Will I find shelter in the places the Sun could never find?<br>
Now behold the consequence, the aftermath of ignorance,<br>
shackled to my worthless neck.<br>
Give me one reason to resist.<br>
So I slip below.<br>
I can't resist the undertow.<br>
I find no solace beneath a Godless sky.<br>
Will I find shelter in the places the Sun could never find?<br>
Because everything's turning black and I see no hope of turning back.<br><br>
Cold terror grips my lungs,<br>
to let it in would be to accept defeat.<br><br>
But what's left to fight for?<br>
When I look inside, nothingness confronts me.<br>
Vexed by the hands of time.<br>
This is survival.<br>
I against I.<br><br>
What's left inside?<br>
So I slip below.<br>
I can't resist the undertow.<br>
I can't resist.<br>
No, I can feel the deadweight.<br>
I can feel the deadweight of my<br>
soul dragging me from this world.</p>

            <p class="lyrics-test-test">Shifting light outlines my battered form.<br>
Stranger to the world, alone in my abandonment.<br>
A gaining army of white horses,<br>
stark warning before the icy front.<br><br>
The deceiving calm betrays all signs of impeding change.<br>
Evening tide what do you hide, damnation or salvation?<br>
As my skin breaks the blackened surface,<br>
the cold is rising, yer all embracing.<br>
Darkness, erase this lonesome place from my every existence.<br>
An angry sky bares the signs,<br>
a distant violence yet to break.<br><br>
The ocean's travellers cry forth across the waves.<br>
Lightning cracks across a vast horizon,<br>
reaching out its hands towards an unsuspecting shore.<br>
No light to guide.<br>
No ties, no ties to bind.<br>
Evening Tide what do you hide?<br><br>
To the years spent waiting on the winds of change,<br>
this is penance paid.<br>
This is my penance paid,<br>
to the morning Sun,<br>
whose warmth never found this young man's face.<br>
Shifting light outlines my battered form.<br>
Stranger to the world.<br><br>
Alone.<br>
Evening tide, what do you hide?<br>
Lightning cracks across a vast horizon,<br>
reaching out its hand towards an unsuspecting shore.<br>
With a final effort I strike out across the swells,<br>
seeking only the answers, maybe horizons hold.

the darkness,<br>
yet I feel desire's cold grip upon my heart no more.<br>
My solitude.<br>
My shield.<br>
My armour.<br>
Tested with full force.<br>
I have seen the face of death and I choose not to accept its form.<br>
I have seen the face of death.<br>
An army of demons summoned forth,<br>
upon this endless night they swam.<br><br>
The fire in their eyes,<br>
like new Suns shire through the abyss.<br>
I taste the fear.<br>
I see the weakness in their eyes.<br>
They cannot hide as I devour all.<br>
As the mountains crack and the oceans boil,<br>
a fury-tempered heart is forged.<br>
Within the flames,<br>
this current of corruption will cease.<br><br>
I taste the fear.<br><br>
I see the weakness in their eyes.<br>
They cannot hide as I devour all.<br>
An army of demons summoned forth.<br>

From the darkest abyss, from the depths of eternal rest.<br>
Grasping at the threads of sanity, only to watch them slip through my hands.<br>
I see the light.<br>
I see the end.<br>
I see a frail hope, crushed by the weight of the world.<br>
My will is broken.<br>
Sinking, always sinking.<br>
The sands of time forever slipping.<br>
Clawing at the emptiness, but a ghost I reach towards the end.<br>
Lost in darkness.<br>
Lost in time.<br><br>
Losing a grip on my fucking mind.<br>
Ignorance is an easy friend but in the end it takes everything.<br>
Fear, it finds me and it binds me.<br>
Illuminate the planes of consciousness.<br>
Fear, it finds me<br>
and it binds me.<br><br>
But I'm lost.<br>
Guilt draws me down like a stone.<br>
it chokes my throat, and gnaws my bones.<br>
Regret breeds a heavy heart.<br>
Reality, torn in two.<br>
Canonised, a life that fades before my eyes.<br>
Ever faithful friend, sorrow, sets its teeth.<br>
Eaten alive.<br>
But I will survive.<br><br>
I survive.<br>
Fury, deliver me.<br>
How can you defeat what you can't kill?<br>
Deliver me.<br>
I see the fear that twists inside.<br>

I watch the shadows fill with doubt.<br>
Deliver me.<br>
Fury deliver me.</p>

My convictions lay bare before the tempest.<br>
As chaos explodes around me, I find myself in the jaws of destruction.<br>
Tested, by the force of the tempest.<br>
Pushed, to the point of no return.<br>
Losing ground.<br><br>
Let the steel of my resolve be not bested by the sum of my fears.<br>
Clarity unfolds, a moments calm in the eye of the storm.<br>
Relentless, I surge onward.<br>
Surfacing.<br>
No regrets.<br>
No second chance.<br>
Nothing will hold me back.<br><br>
Shipwrecked bones carry my seasick heart home.<br>
Carry me home.<br>
Tension clings to me.<br><br>
Resistance coils inside.<br>
Forcing me down, I fear nothing, into Poseidon's arms.<br>
Forcing me down, I fear nothing, I must hold on.<br>
This is a strength born in misery.<br><br>
A focus cut of this insanity.<br>
I fight my way from the gates of hell.<br>
I hold on.<br>
A body, locked in the vice grip of conflict.<br>
A mind, sharpened on the shards of disappointment.<br>
And from the depths of Hell I rise.<br>
From gilded cage, my spirit flies.<br>
Memories of another life call me home.<br>
Surfacing.<br><br>
Shipwrecked bones<br>
carry my seasick heart home.

If home is where the heart is, why do I feel so fucking heartless?<br>
The crumbling skyline cuts a vicious horizon,<br>
sinking its teeth into the cold September sky.<br>
Decaying towers of steel reach<br><br>
with crooked spires for the heavens,<br>
like bones of the hollow chest of this town,<br>
torn wide for the scavengers.<br>
Mother mercy, take my hand.<br>
Follow me through this forsaken land.<br><br>
Father time, return what's mine.<br>
The innocence you stole from these eyes.<br>
Because I feel numb. For the vision<br>
burning before me is one of former glory.<br>
An icon cast in the light of freer times,<br>
now writhes in a bed of lies.<br>
Hope doesn't live here.<br>
Love doesn't live here anymore.<br>
Mother mercy, take my hand.<br><br>
Follow me through this forsaken land.<br>
Father time, return what's mine.<br>
The innocence you stole from these eyes.<br>
Because I just feel numb.</p>

Lies.<br>
My truth has been revealed, at the cost of everything I knew.<br>
My last safe-haven falls behind me,<br>
with the self that once consumed.<br>
Into the void.<br>
I'm pursuing only answers.<br><br>
I'm shedding skins and faces, past loves and bitter hatreds.<br>
And it has come to pass,<br>
a path set in stone now breaks like glass.<br>
The failings of yesterday become the catalyst to seek my change.<br>
And it has come to pass,<br>
a path set in stone now breaks like glass.<br>
The failings of yesterday become my catalyst.<br>
So here I stand, a stranger to my newfound freedom.<br><br>
I am a vessel.<br>
I am a vessel without destination, devoid of direction.<br>
No roles define m, yet conflict embraces me.<br>
At the mercy if lucidity,<br>
I am adrift in a world all to real.<br>
A hollow man.<br><br>
Into the arms of eternal struggle,<br><br>
I must condemn my restless mind.<br>
And it has come to pass,<br>
a path set in stone now breaks like glass.<br>
The failings of yesterday<br><br>
become the catalyst to seek my change.<br>
And it has come to pass,<br>
a path set in stone now breaks like glass.<br>
The failings of yesterday become<br>
my catalyst I seek the guidance gained from silence.<br>
Illumination from within the darkness.<br>

in the heart of the unknown.</p>

My thoughts drowned out.<br>
Screeching and grinding resonates through a hollow shell.<br>
There is no great wisdom.<br>
There are no answers.<br>

I close my eyes, but all I see is red.<br>
I bite my tongue, but all I taste is blood.<br>
Once again they set their traps, set their hooks, deep in my head.<br>
Too naive to think these forked tongues would themselves devour.<b<br>
Show me war.<br><br>
Show me pestilence.<br>
Show me the blood red hands of retribution.<br>
<br>
And the abyss stares back.<br>
Leviathan I.<br>
<br>
To break their hold, strip the flesh straight from their bones.<br>
<br>
Cast their limbs into the gears of the beast.<br>
Bring this monstrosity to its fucking knees.<br>
Eye for an eye.<br>
<br>
I'll send this world blind.<br>
Show me war.<br>
Show me pestilence.<br>
Show me the blood red hands of retribution.<br>

Beneath a hunter's moon.<br>

Too far removed.<br>
Too far to care.<br>
