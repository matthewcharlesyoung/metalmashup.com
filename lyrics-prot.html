They burn down our worn protection<br>
I won't take pictures from their frame<br>
Whatever as always<br>

With their hands that sold me everything<br>
Slapped a price tag on my chest<br>

Bit my tongue and shut my mouth<br>
Tried to blend in with the rest<br>
But I'm a square peg<br>

And if it's not broken we need to break it<br>
There's no such thing as unconditional<br>
No contracts bind you in the end<br>
Make no mistake, this is a killing ground<br>

These days I don't know these people that I'm supposed to trust<br>
And I don't trust these motherfuckers that I'm supposed to know<br>

Now they sell them all for blow<br>

Here's to their failing fucking health<br>

Pew by pew and row on row, they’re taught to revere him.<br>

And fear themselves, and fear they should.<br>
And fear themselves, and fear they will (God is dead).<br>

Fear the vengeance of a changing tide.<br>
Fear the gap in your conscience that’s ten miles wide.<br>

misguided accusations, you’ve no right to your pride.<br>

Those that are truly afraid are ashamed of their own urges.<br>

of murderers and drug dealers with whom you share<br>
no regard for life before you set and ensnare the same victims.<br>
Outlining the qualities by combining varied breeds.<br>
Breed specific legislation falls flat on its only short snout.<br>
A death squad assembled. Why put up a fight?<br>
The round up resembles a Crystal Night.<br>
<br>
In relation to temperament,<br>
they pass with an overwhelming percent (86.4%).<br>
The American pit bull v. the American dream.<br>
The task is ours to keep our dogs and children safe.<br>
Disregard the media, or the province, or the state.<br>
With a different target every decade or so,<br>
you can wait until they break into your home.<br>
Repeat the lies you’ve bought and sold and say,<br>
“You should look up the facts”<br>
when you should look up the facts your fuckin’ self.<br>
Or you could stand for a dog that’s not your<br>
own because your own damn dog is next.<br>
I’m proud of every pit bull, but ashamed of my own country.<br>
I oppose any legislature that should try and stop me<br>
And if a pit bull is a weapon, you’ll have to pry them<br>
And if a pit bull is a weapon, you’ll have to pry them<br>
I won’t stop until they lift these, these ridiculous bans.<br>
And if a pit bull is a weapon, you’ll have to pry them<br>
And if a pit bull is a weapon, you’ll have<br>
to pry them from my cold, dead hands.

          <h1 id="t8" class="lyrics-test">-Mist-</h1>
          <p class="lyrics-test-test">About a gunshot away<br>
there’s a place that I long to be -<br>
tippin’ bottles with me old cock.<br>
When the shit’s all said and sorted, I plan to settle down and stay -<br>
one middle finger to the landlocked.<br>
From the first time boatin’ or there’s not too much I can recall.<br>
I kissed a plastic cod and drank rum till I was friggered.<br>
I decided then and there that I’d return, even if I had to crawl.<br>
Something outside was broken and something inside me, triggered.<br>
<br>
It’s a long ride home, but it’s always my destination.<br>
It’s a long ride home.<br>
<br>
If the sun bursts apart at the end of the world,<br>
I don’t think I will give a damn<br>
as long as I’m surrounded by friends<br>
and pints in goddamned Newfoundland.<br>
So here’s to Newfoundland.<br>
<br>
I breathed a sigh of relief the next time steppin’ off the plane.<br>
It’d been a long, hard, vapid winter.<br>
Johnny and the boys were waiting there ready to explain,<br>
they weren’t there to drive us, just a welcome back to the Island.<br>
So we taxied to the venue to prepare for the night to sweep.<br>
Slept in the back room until the India showed up.<br>
When we finally took the stage, it shifted beneath our feet.<br>
We stood on the shoulders of proud Newfoundlanders.<br>
<br>
I think it bears repeating<br>
I think it bears repeating<br>
I think it bears repeating that no one buckled under.<br>
We all got bit by the cod that we all kissed.<br>
It left an infection in our lips and a longing in the mist.<br>
<br>
You’re as deep as the grave,<br>
and you’re marching to the heartbeat of the land.<br>
You’re as deep as the grave,<br>
and you’re marching to the heartbeat of the land.<br>
Yes, I be a Newfoundlander B’y.<br>
Not by birth, but in my heart.<br>
Yes, I be a Newfoundlander B’y.<br>
Yes, I be a Newfoundlander B’y.<br>
Not by birth, but in my heart.<br>
Yes, I be a Newfoundlander B’y.<br>
You’re as deep as the grave,<br>
and you’re marching to the heartbeat of the land.<br>
You’re as deep as the grave,<br>
and you’re marching to the heartbeat of the land.

          <h1 id="t9" class="lyrics-test">-Underbite-</h1>
          <p class="lyrics-test-test">So how you fuckin’ feeling tonight?<br>
We’re (insert name here) from unimportant,<br>
and I’m about to mimic some image of a<br>
rock and roll singer I have under lock and key.<br>
Without the faintest hint of irony<br>
that I’m flashing my pearly whites to sustain my mediocrity.<br>
So is everyone having a good time tonight?<br>
Good, I’m glad (I couldn’t actually care less).<br>
You guys are the best crowd that we’ve ever seen,<br>
seen with these old dead eyes.<br>
Blind to the stage or even my own lies.<br>
<br>
So hey ho, let’s go. Let’s start
this contemptible “rock” show.<br>
Blinding lights to hide the hand up<br>
our ass in this puppet-sock show.<br>
Two sewn on eyes, repurposed and made new,<br>
torn from an aging suit for a sense of déjà vu.<br>
Thumb underbite. I bite my fucking thumb,<br>
and hope you catch a thread, and slowly come undone.<br>
<br>
An illusion seldom spoken. An understanding between you and I<br>
that the ground that you stand on is somehow less than mine.<br><br>
An allusion to a broken home,<br>
left on the street and chilled to the bone.<br>
So hey, we still feeling good?<br>
Now you comprehend our complex<br>
relationship—consumer/consumed.<br>
You’re just some stupid kid and I’m a megalomaniac.<br>
<br>
Shedding defenses for an honest creation.<br>
Placing yourself in the stocks on the strap.<br>
You’re disgracing your effort by conforming to textbook<br>
performance of music to fill in the gaps,<br>
and it’s bullshit.<br>
It’s bullshit. Be honest, this can’t be what you wanted,<br>
if what you write about means anything to you.<br>
Rather than pure vanity, people might connect with sincerity.<br>
Don’t just pray the next generation learns from our mistakes.<br>
Let’s not repackage the same old performance.<br>
Original content is so much more rewarding.<br>
Let’s not repackage the same old performance.<br>
Original content is so much more rewarding.<br>
I know that it might be quite cliché,<br>
but if all the world is in fact a stage,<br>
then this stage—this here goddamn stage—<br>
might just be all the world.</p>

          <h1 id="t10" class="lyrics-test">-Animal Bones-</h1>
          <p class="lyrics-test-test">Why do you torture me so?<br>
You sit across the table with both eyes closed.<br>
You speak in myth and fable, and stand unopposed.<br>
The animal bones reveal themselves from deep within your mane.<br>
They reach for ethereal light.<br>
The ancient spears rise from her shoulders and riddle your frame,<br>
marking the first time it was done right.<br>
<br>
And that’s not all that haunts me - the death by fire of a child<br>
who waits so patiently. And we are the ones<br>
who set the standard by which we are to be measured.<br>
Measured, measured!<br>
Some things can never walk again cause<br>
sometimes a step is all too vile.<br>
The path of five innocent men who are<br>
only capable of walking one last mile.<br>
<br>
If I could live another day over again, I’d choose not to.<br>
The successes and failures of days passed are constant.<br>
The horizon promises days ahead.<br>
If you won’t quit, then I won’t.<br>
<br>
And this I swear to you tonight<br>
upon these former embers<br>
you fanned until they were fire.<br>
<br>
We are nothing without the thousands of voices that make the choir.<br>
Nothing without the thousands of voices that make the choir.<br>
We are, we are, we are still life.<br>
(We are, we are, we are still life)<br>
We are, we are, we are... still life<br>
<br>
Begging and pleading, not dying,<br>
but bleeding out. (Still life, still life)<br>
Begging and pleading, not dying,<br>
but bleeding out. (Still life, still life)<br>
Oh, the chemical reaction, the chemical.<br>
Oh, the chemical reaction.<br>
<br>
When the walls fell, with arms wide.

          <h1 id="t11" class="lyrics-test">-Skies-</h1>
          <p class="lyrics-test-test">Cough, gasp, and sputter,<br>
spinning helplessly down toward the earth.<br>
A loss of control, the sky swallows whole.<br>
Spinning down, down.<br>
Forever falling down, down, down.<br>
<br>
But is it entirely a flightless fall?<br>
No deceptive currents, no rise at all?<br>
Maybe it’s too naive to not jump ship<br>
when deviating so drastically from the initial script.<br>
<br>
Tremble beneath the weight of inevitability,<br>
and all the casualties therein.<br>
Cower in the shadow of the ever-present sun,<br>
witness eclipsing, eclipsing, eclipsed.<br>
<br>
Is it completely void? Or is the truth in shade?<br>
Are all the facts before us a masquerade?<br>
Suffering no deceit, no selfish lies,<br>
we stand in our own crypt and we mobilize,<br>
waking up to blazing heat<br>
and the stench of rancid meat.<br>
Don’t have the patience or the time to repeat mistakes.<br>
Like high, hot hauls, through highway tolls<br>
with bigger brothers for hungry trolls.<br>
Each horn sharpened by eye sockets torn,<br>
standing on the graves of the worn.<br>
Welcome to the place integrity is born.<br>
Heart in the right place, just missing the mark.<br>
Feigning exception is a shot in the dark.<br>
With no remorse and no regret,<br>
is anybody listening yet?<br>
<br>
Tremble beneath the weight of inevitability,<br>
and all the casualties therein.<br>
Cower in the shadow of the ever-present sun,<br>
witness eclipsing, eclipsing, eclipsed.<br>
<br>
Bask in uncertainty.<br>
Strange things can happen when faced with adversity.<br>
Ask and you shall receive,<br>
or swing frantic your arms. Fate is nothing but a nervous belief.<br>
I don’t believe the end is in pavement.<br>
I don’t believe there’s anything beneath.<br>
I don’t believe there’s death in the basement,<br>
no I don’t believe.<br>
<br>
No I don’t believe.<br>
<br>
Embrace the fall, there is no end.<br>
No ambiguous hypothesis to comprehend.<br>
No bruised and battered egos in descent’s entire ethos.<br>
No magnificent creation myth. No wind to pad the story with.<br>
Only I will never quit, or watch my brothers quit,<br>
but I’ll lower down a lifeboat if you’re abandoning the ship.<br>
“True sailing’s dead,” should have been the first thing said<br>
before the writing could be written, before the writing could be read.<br>
<br>
The wreckage was never found,<br>
but the black box was recovered.<br>
The message therein profound.<br>
In our final moments our true names are all discovered.<br>
So let it fall, fall. Even if it turns out to be futile,<br>
at least we couldn’t ask for a sky so clear or a day more beautiful.<br>
They’ll never find the wreckage, transcending all human languages.<br>
Just a promise and a final message: the descent is all there truly ever is.<br>
Just a promise and a final message: the descent is all there ever is.<br>
Just a promise and a, just a promise and a final message:<br>
the fall is all there ever is.<br>
Just a promise and a final message: the descent is all there ever is.<br>
Just a promise and a, just a promise and a final message:<br>
the fall is all there ever is.<br>
<br>
Stumble beneath the radar, big holes in each great city<br>
is all the evidence I need.<br>
Knowledge often beckons and can lead astray.<br>
Whisper release me, release me, release.<br>
Dive into an endless sea.<br>
No reason to falter no plan supersedes.<br>
Altering frequencies,<br>
but we welcome the change. Fate is nothing but a nervous disease.<br>
<br>
Cough, gasp, and sputter,<br>
spinning helplessly down toward the earth.<br>
A loss of control, the sky swallows whole.<br>
Spinning down, down.<br>
Forever falling down, down, down.
