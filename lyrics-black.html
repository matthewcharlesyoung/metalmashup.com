      <p class="lyrics-test-test">I live in the weak and the wounded<br>
I wait for what the wolves leave in their wake<br>
And when mankind draws its final breath<br>
Through its gaping mouth its soul I'll take<br><br>

The death cult rising, join me in annihilation<br>
All will fall before the dark<br>
Eliminate the sufferers and those causing the suffering<br>
This is plague worship<br><br>

This is plague worship<br>
Now, kneel before the onset<br>
Of human abolition<br><br>

Human life is scorned<br>
This is nihilism given form<br>
The only beings that are capable of evil<br>
Fulfill your moral duty and destroy your people<br><br>

Pestilence<br>
Decay and rot<br>
A plague deity<br>
To wash away the sins of man<br>

Prostrate yourself before the altar of contagion<br>
Breathe in deep this gift of deadly exhalation<br>
Decay is the way of all things, careless of a peasant or king<br>
Only death prevails<br><br>

Prostrate yourself before the altar of contagion<br>
Prove your fealty to the plague<br>
And when mankind draws its final breath<br>
Only death prevails</p>

run rampant, through the heavens<br>

His fangs carve a bloody swathe; red stains the maiden's gown<br>
Blood and the snow<br>
Her bonds tighten, her cancer stands to attention<br>
Blood and the snow<br>
Cough black tar into the dust<br><br>

The devouring son is risen<br>
Pray the earth is swallowed by the sun<br>
An infinite night<br><br>

This cold is all consuming, I dread these shadows looming<br>
The sun is setting with the lights burning low<br>
Horned crowns and cloven hooves; the unthinking callow youth;<br>
these demons walk with a sickness in two<br><br>

I feel it growing<br>

Walking the earth; creatures of deception, loathsome since birth<br>
Blood. Snow. Herald of fire. Voice of ruin<br><br>

Speak to the hearts of men<br>

A city turns to ash - black death<br>
The flames grow tall,<br>
charred husks,<br>
blistered flesh<br>
This sickness forced our hand<br>
We had to take a stand against those who reprimand this necessary evil<br><br>

Everyone casts a shadow where even light can't reach<br>
It hides our deepest, darkest desires of which we dare not speak<br><br>

Curse the earth. Take it back<br>
The night is always darkest before the dawn,<br>
but there's still always black<br><br>

This is the way<br>
We are humanity - a walking scourge - the twilight phase of living disease<br>
We are humanity - a walking scourge that curses the earth<br><br>

Shall we rejoice that we live in dusk and not the night?<br>
Is it enough to merely suffer?<br>
After all, our sons will be the ones left alone against this final blight<br>
Shall we rejoice?<br>
Shall we rejoice at the dying of the light?<br><br>

Silence is deep as eternity,<br>
speech is shallow as time<br>
Onwards, always onwards,<br>
our unending misery in silence and doom: this eternal gloom<br><br>

Shall we rejoice that we live in dusk and not the night?<br>
Is it enough to merely suffer?<br>
After all, our sons will be the ones left alone against this final blight<br>
Shall we rejoice?<br>
Shall we rejoice at the dying of the light?<br><br>

Long is the path away from doubt, void of light</p>

Will you never subside?<br>
By the time it had happened<br>
I'd lived it a thousand times<br>
Behind closed eyes<br>
Its keen edge blunted<br>
But the ache still resides<br><br>

The cold eased its grip on my bones<br>
This sun was the first I'd known<br>
The mad chorus calmed at the touch of your hand<br>
The voices disarmed<br><br>

The wind calls my name<br>
I dare not answer<br>
I dare not speak<br><br>

But had I known the collared throats<br>
The hand on winter's wrist<br>
Heard the command of your lying lips<br>
I would have bitten off your tongue<br>
During our first kiss<br><br>

There was no misery<br>
Nor sadness, nor pain<br>

And the hand on winter's wrist<br>
Heard the sound of your lying lips<br>
(The frost could never be as cold as you)<br><br>


I stand at the mountain before the abyss<br>
(The wind calls my name)<br>
Though the biting wind is cruel<br>
(The wind calls my name)<br>

Forged in the blackest reaches of irony<br>

My body screams through the static<br>
In front of me dangles the key<br><br>

A hand of winter dream and purest ivory<br>
Tears and dust run as the Styx beneath my feet<br>

"The Gate has opened<br>
A passage for the weary<br>
And a bed for the weak"<br>

Casting the shadow of unceasing sleep<br><br>

I watch you from across the lake<br>
Where the waters remain forever still<br>
I watch you from across the lake<br>
Where the waters remain forever still<br>

And I collapse to the bank still green<br>
And scream hoarse with the whisper of the leaves<br>
And you were bountiful then and I asked you why<br>
Small, frail, dependent, I<br><br>

Should have to watch you walk from the shoreline, grey<br>
You smiled something about life and something about time<br>
Something about the winding length of mine<br>
How I'd be ready when it came to that day<br><br>

But I am not<br>
And every nerve recoils at the thought<br>
That the vessels still remain but are filled with nought<br><br>

A light switched off<br>
A stopped clock<br>
A loss<br>
A light switched off<br>
A stopped clock and a loss<br><br>

Death, take me home<br>
Death, take me home<br><br>

The cloak flaps blackly<br>
My fingers map the lines<br>
Across the writing on your monuments<br>
Of life and death and time<br>
The cloak flaps blackly<br>
My fingers map the lines<br>
Across the writing on your monuments<br><br>
I ponder the winding<br>
Of life and death and time<br><br>

And I hope to God the next passage on the waiting raft is mine<br>
Please don't leave me here between life and death and time<br><br>

Please don't leave me here<br>
Please don't leave me here<br>
Please don't leave me here<br>
Please don't leave me here<br><br>


Death, take me home<br>
Death, take me home<br>
Death, take me to the lake where the waters remain forever still</p>

        <h1 id="s9" class="lyrics-test">-A Dying God Coming Into Human Flesh-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">All is cold and frozen<br>
Frozen the sea<br>
Frozen the sky<br>
Frozen is death<br>
But I cannot die<br>
Cannot die<br><br>

As the snow falls<br>
To cover this all<br>
And all is cold<br>
And cold, cold is all<br>
All is cold, cold is all<br><br>

Cold<br>
Frozen<br>
Frozen is Heaven and frozen is Hell<br>
And I am dying in this living human shell<br><br>

I am a dying God, coming into human flesh<br>
I am a dying God, coming into human flesh<br>
I am a dying God, coming into human flesh<br>
I am a dying God<br><br>

Frozen my heart<br>
Frozen my soul<br>
Frozen my love<br><br>

I am a dying God, coming into human flesh<br>
I am a dying God, coming into human flesh<br>
I am a dying God, coming into human flesh<br>
I am a dying God, coming into human flesh<br>
I am a dying God, coming into human flesh<br>
I am a dying God, coming into human flesh<br>
I am a dying God, coming into human flesh<br>
I am a dying God, coming into human flesh</p>

        <h1 id="s10" class="lyrics-test">-Crippled Before the Dwelling Place of God-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">I lay, torn and aghast, at the gates of the dwelling place of God<br>

My body is broken<br>
Every bone shattered against its rails<br>
Every vein spilled across its towers<br>
My blood flows in rivers with the grain<br><br>

If I could cry still, I would<br>
But all tears are spent<br>
My mouth shudders the words I screamed<br>
As I pounded on those unmoving doors<br>
My silent lament<br><br>

There is no greater Hell than isolation<br><br>

And so as you were in life<br>
You shall be in death<br>
Alone within, alone without<br><br>

In the eons, that echo twists and throbs<br>
And coalesces beside the palest form of quivering<br>
Outside the dwelling place of God<br>
A crystal hand caresses his face<br>
Closing the eyes of his unseeing frown<br><br>

I felt that final kiss with lightning's crack<br>
The echo reaches through time and space in the black<br>
From that old room with the rope<br>
As my vertebrae snaps</p>
