Consciousness found<br>
Amplified are the senses now<br>
Fully merged with the beyond<br>
Consciousness found<br><br>
Fragmented mental shards<br>
Transported to alternate dimensions<br>
All timelines lead back to you<br>
Infinite timelines lead back to you<br>
Was my purpose to fall off course and<br>
Forewarn the earth of these revelations viewed?<br>
Here I am now
To forewarn your world of revelations viewed

            <p class="footer-text article-margin">Here at Metal Mashup you will find a site that celebrates all things heavy and metal. Yet in an effort to move away from the more mainstream aspects of our scene, Metal Mashup has a much-needed focus on the more underground achievements of our community. Don’t get us wrong though, while we all love a bit of Metallica and still lose our shit every time Hetfield sneezes or Lars manages to keep time, we just feel that there is more to our clan that needs to be celebrated.</p>
