And what we've done here,<br>
What you have left so far behind.<br>
So here's to progress,<br>
Here's to the rest of our lives.<br>

Products justified by his hate.<br>
Motionless and unproductive.<br>
Seven souls will dance upon his grave,<br>
Which will be paid in full.<br>

And to continue, get with the program.<br>
You've just jumped on the bandwagon.<br>
I've got you right where I want you.<br>
Yes I've got you in the palm of my hands.<br>

A contemporary crook of these digital dollars.<br>

Putting a price on what you're worth.<br>

In this house we're in<br>
In here with all these fears<br>
Lie down and wait for me to grow old<br>

From somewhere<br>
I guess I have seen before<br><br>

Than what you have taught me<br>
To show me the rivers<br>
Life living underneath a billboard<br>
The sidewalks infested<br>
The people of plastic<br>
<br>
Ok, so I've been holding out<br>
Lying my weight on the door<br>
Up above, I've never felt so numb<br>
Until I made it out<br>
They put a target on your forehead<br>
The day that you were born<br>
<br>
I've waited my entire life, sitting on the sides<br>
Everyday I hear you say that it gets easier with time<br>
A life I never ruined, a light to show me out this time<br>
And maybe, and maybe I was right all along<br>
The day you were born, a solid mark...<br>

Do you believe in everything?<br>
Do you believe in everything and everyone you meet?<br>
Do you believe in everything?<br>

Being remembered in waves<br>
It meant the world<br>
A pioneer expecting the worst<br>

From a pressed colored label<br>
You rebuild with your hands<br>
A vision I have known<br>
To feel the extract underneath the palms<br>
In an enhanced nighttime<br>
With the weight of viruality<br>
Like the sound when planes collide<br>
To the ground in my eyes<br>
<br>
I lost myself deep within its depths<br>
I'll surface with time in the waters where we met<br>
You lost your sight<br>
So remember how it used to be<br>
So get used to me<br>
I'll see you on the other side<br>

From Wilshire to Grand Central,<br><br>
buildings will crumble, crumble, structures to piles.<br>

Labeled the catalyst, the X amount,<br><br>

Live for this vivid vision. A vision I see,<br>
A vision for you.<br>
From my window I could see exploding<br>
lights underneath the veil over the speedway.<br>
Guilt for it. I punch right through the skies;<br>
distilled, pulling the clouds.<br><br>
I see you in a million dimensions,<br>
now you are finally found.<br>
<br>
I wrote all night long.<br><br>
We always did exactly what we were told,<br>
They never wanted us to know.<br>
I wrote all night long,<br>
A vision of a place that we call home.<br>
About a lifetime that we once knew,<br><br>
They never wanted us to know.<br>
The age of innocence,<br>
A vision of a place that we call home.<br>
The story of the oversaw, oversaw.<br>

Your loyalty means nothing to me.<br>
Expect to be stopped, not to be fucked.<br>

Like a diamond<br>

With money to be made<br>
Quit lying to yourself and make the move<br>

Collapsed in black<br>

Used to call home<br>

This has been their plan for years<br>
The signing of the dead<br>
And the bodies you showed me<br><br>
Put me in the plastic box that I paid for<br>

In the middle of the desert<br>

To see them touch the ground<br>
Imploding on the cracked mud surface<br>

I knelt down underneath the midway<br>
In the millionth sighting<br>
<br>
Lets lay back<br>
Sitting inside my car<br>
At the edge of the earth<br>
I turned my head to the left<br>
And I knew I could not be drugged<br>
Orbs with infusion white<br>
Mirroring the image of a silhouete<br>
At the edge of the earth<br>

And I'm here tonight<br>
Underneath the influence<br>
And why can't I find a way out<br>
It's calling me tonight<br>
This secret I have become<br>
At the edge of the earth<br>

You misunderstood the gravity<br>
As the weight falls apart<br>
You'll watch me walk away<br>
I walk away<br>
Calm as the wind<br>
You'll watch me go<br>

That resonate the skies<br>
In between the visual lines<br>
Encompassing pines<br>
In the greenery commons<br>
Is it pressed in a book<br>
<br>
A history unknown<br>
An isle of concentrated mineral<br>
In elapsed time<br>
Directions to locate the fountain of karrots<br>
The sight of gold<br>
<br>
They sat me down on a point<br>
And my eyes looked up in texture<br>
The illuminating brim<br>
A solid trilogy circle<br>
Embedded in the rock orbital<br>
When I'm gone you know where you can find me<br>
Here<br>
<br>
It was immaculate<br>
In its beauty a thousand words<br>
Could never describe the colored brights<br>
Forever, to a shore<br>
<br>
Where you can dig the earth<br>
And let it run through your hands<br>
As deep as it will glow<br>
We savored the last hour with the turning of the sun<br>
<br>
A visual shrine<br>
Existing with electronic lines<br>
An inseparable sign<br>
Intertwined with the corkscrewed<br>
Manifested woman<br>
<br>
In front of me, toxicity<br>
In front of me, she barely stood<br>
Take me there<br>
It was immaculate<br>
In its beauty a thousand words<br>
Could never describe the colored brights<br>
Forever, to a shore

<br>
It's the way that you do me babe<br>
It's what you do to me<br>
I move with you so perfectly<br>
Take it off as I pull you across the bed<br>
From your head to your feet<br>
A fever rising vigorously<br>
<br>
Reminiscing on the lust you know how it was<br>
The feeling of the warmth of your breath and your touch<br>
Laying in bed with that scent of yours<br>
Staying here instead 'cause I wanted more<br>
<br>
This is the coming of the storm<br>
Can you feel the form?<br>
In perfect patterns in a perfect dream<br>
We are starting up a war, starting up a war<br>
Intoxicated by the lies we breathe<br>
We are duplicitous and insidious<br>
You've pushed me further than I've ever dreamed<br>
We are starting up a war, starting up a war<br>
It should've ended but we just can't leave so far

There's nothing more than I would like to put this gun to your face<br>

And I'll pull it in a minute<br>
But first I got something priceless to say<br>
<br>
The memories<br>
All the shit that you did to me<br>
Nothing else will follow<br>
Fuck the sterling, I'll take the gold<br>
I've been here too many times before<br>

You fade away as I walk my way<br>
You're just a bitch so rotten<br>
The thought of you just gets me dazed<br>
I hope you go forgotten<br>
<br>
You'll fucking go forgotten<br>
Fucking go forgotten<br>
<br>
I tried for weeks to be so honest<br>
Finally feel my feet against the floor<br>
We take the lies from what's upon us<br>
I cannot listen to you anymore<br>
Looking for something always searching<br>
Never got my hands to touch the door<br>
But now I see the table turning<br>
Forgetting what your face looked like before<br>
<br>
You fade away as I walk my way<br>
You're just a bitch so rotten<br>
The thought of you just gets me dazed<br>
I hope you go forgotten<br>

An inquisition of who I would become<br>
Who I see in myself<br>
When the gravel got loose<br>
And you were just trying to help me<br>

Afterlife is something that you think about<br>
When you're caught up in that moment<br>
That moment you don't wanna dream about<br>

When you want something more<br>
And she said I was stuck<br>
And I should have pulled you out of that truck<br>

I knew it<br>
I would have picked you up<br>
I would have been there<br>

By my self regret<br>
As I perceive narcotic<br>
Living life always keeping the weight in line<br>
But then you see the world just like I do<br>

Feed me until I'm sick<br>
Drown me out in white<br>
Drown me out along with everyone<br>
Not even here to fight this fight<br>

Not to be heard when I watch you talk, forget it<br>
Neon eyes always seeing the darker side<br>

He doesn't give a fuck<br>
See him walking down the freeway<br>
And it's twelve o' clock<br>

He's held up in an office on the 20th floor<br>
He turns it off<br>
He turns it all off<br>

And I worship you with every pore<br>
I'd snort it all, I'd snort it all<br>

It's called addiction<br>
Caught up in the system<br>
The friction of feeling constructed<br>
Oh I'm lost, I'm lost, I'm lost<br>
<br>
Without a depiction<br>
My soul's a victim afflicted<br>
I know I'm a sick kid<br>
Oh I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone<br>

It feels so flawless<br>
The summer in august when we fell in love<br>
Looking back remember when we first met<br>
The morning dove into my soul made of gold. No<br>
How could you be so thoughtless?<br>
My lover my goddess I was so in love with<br>
How could you be so faithless?<br>
Ignore dedication<br>
I showed her through<br>
<br>
Without you without me<br>
And I'm not being honest<br>
I get it back to get me off<br>

But I'm stuck in this rut that I've dug and I'm fucked<br>

Always dismissed do you get the gist?<br>

Always kneeling down<br>
I'm an addict with a crown<br>
Don't you love the sound when my body hits the ground<br>

Locked in a catacomb<br>
With a love syndrome<br>
About to implode explode<br>
I don't condone<br>
This endless cyclone<br>

200 calls on my phone that I missed voice mails<br>
Talkin bout where u at where u been<br>
I need to know who u with<br>
I already told u that I'm with the homies recording<br>
I can't be reportin my moves all day<br>
More time with you less money go my way<br>
Lemme do my thang, lemme rock my chain<br>
When I get home let the dingaling swing<br>

She left me alone<br>
Broken at home<br>
Gripping that chrome<br>
Locked in a catacomb<br>
With a love syndrome<br>
About to implode explode<br>
I don't condone<br>
This endless cyclone<br>
<br>
She can send me into overdrive<br>
We do this all the time<br>
Now she's coming over every night<br>
Like I'm always on her mind<br>
She can show things, get anything<br>
I'm always on the line<br>
Now she's coming over every night<br>
Like I'm always on her mind<br>
<br>
Locked out and she's a loaded gun<br>
Cause she knows how I like my fun<br>
Straight down into another one<br>
Cause she knows she's not the only one<br>
<br>
You not the only one<br>
You think I owe u sum'<br>
You think you know me<br>
But you not the lonely one<br>
I don't feel anything anymore<br>
Look me in my eyes<br>
I'm ready to die, bust my .45<br>
Break bread with my guys<br>
When I'm counting baby don't hit my line<br>
Turn around bow down lemme feel your spine<br>
<br>
She can send me into overdrive<br>
We do this all the time<br>
Now she's coming over every night<br>
Like I'm always on her mind<br>
She can show things, get anything<br>
I'm always on the line<br>
Now she's coming over every night<br>
Like I'm always on her mind

          <h1 id="t10" class="lyrics-test">-Heavy Silence-</h1>
          <p class="lyrics-test-test">n a heavy silence<br>
Backs in view<br>
Walking through the haunted doorway, writing off the truth<br>
In a pleasant memory of the former you<br>
Its enough to soften judging hearts but yet spoken too soon<br>
<br>
Kuz all the memories are right here inside me<br>
And it's taking all of me not to break or make a scene<br>
Jus leave me alone meet me down below<br>
Pissing on a stone jus to say hello<br>
Lit the herb of grace hit the veins and freeze<br>
In a petty silence mother stews<br>
And I could cut the air in here with a sharpened thought or two<br>
What a fine endeavor, conducting as a tune<br>
At the time I ride my impulses and curb my attitude<br>
<br>
Kuz all the memories are right here inside me<br>
And it's taking all of me not to break or make a scene<br>
<br>
Jus throw it in the moat<br>
Meet me down below<br>
Pissing on a stone<br>
Just to say hello</p>

          <h1 id="t11" class="lyrics-test">-Pullin' Shades-</h1>
          <p class="lyrics-test-test">Fuck<br>
<br>
(Myke Terry/Gus Farias)<br>
I'm sick of playin' the fighter<br>
I hold on tighter<br>
Feelin' you let me go (let go)<br>
Under the pressure of silence<br>
Avoid disguises<br>
You still block me at the door<br>
<br>
(Myke Terry/Gus Farias)<br>
I'm in your eyes<br>
And you still can't see me now<br>
I'm in your sight<br>
But you're looking all around<br>
No wonder why I'm so lost and never found<br>
I keep on lightin' the sound<br>
You keep on pullin' shades down (down)<br>
<br>
(Myke Terry/Gus Farias)<br>
I'm in your eyes<br>
And you still can't see<br> me now (see me now)<br>
I'm in your sight<br>
But you're looking all around (all around)<br>
No wonder why I'm so lost and never found (never found)<br>
I keep on lightin' the sound<br>
You keep on pullin' shades down (pullin' shades down)<br>
<br>
(Myke Terry)<br>
Stuck in the deal I've been handed<br>
Got me stranded<br>
Forced me to swim or drown<br>
Nothings the way that we planned it<br>
Take for granted<br>
The signs that I leave around<br>
You keep on pullin' the shades down<br>
<br>
(Myke Terry/Gus Farias)<br>
I'm in your eyes<br>
And you still can't see me now (see me now)<br>
I'm in your sight<br>
But you're looking all around (all around)<br>
No wonder why I'm so lost and never found (never found)<br>
I keep on lightin' the sound<br>
You keep on pullin' shades down (pullin' shades down)<br>
<br>
(Myke Terry/Gus Farias)<br>
(All around)<br>
I'm in your eyes<br>
And you still can't see me now (see me now)<br>
I'm in your sight<br>
But you're looking all around (all around)<br>
No wonder why I'm so lost and never found (never found)<br>
I keep on lightin' the sound<br>
You keep on pullin' shades down (pullin' shades down)</p>

          <h1 id="t12" class="lyrics-test">-Left For Dead-</h1>
          <p class="lyrics-test-test">Left for dead inside my mind<br>
Alone and fighting for my life<br>
The floor was cold, I was alone<br>
Crucified let me go<br>
Let me fucking go<br>
Fade in, fading out of consciousness<br><br>
Cause everyday feels like I don't exist<br>
So every night's another near death miss<br>
Praying for the day that I don't wake up again<br>
To feel this pain in my mind... fucking take my life<br>
Take my mind<br><br>
Now I'm blind<br>
I'm in a bind<br>
Burn it all tonight<br>
Goddamn<br><br>
Why don't all of you just bury me tonight God damn man... Fuck<br>
Left for dead... inside my mind<br>
Alone and fighting for my life<br>
The floor was cold, I was alone... crucified, let me go
Let me fucking go</p>
