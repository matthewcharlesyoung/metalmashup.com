You just want to jump into it<br>
Diabolical minds think alike<br>
Somewhere you don't belong<br><br>
And the smell of an unwashed dog<br>
No more licks on the lips from now on<br>
Some things don't last forever<br>

With my eyes closed so tightly<br>
He cradles me<br>
Softly we drift into sleep<br>
Turning hands into minerals<br>
I melt into him<br>
My bones depart from me<br>
I open my hands into a pool of water<br>

Everyone come to one<br>
Everyone wants what no one gets<br>

It's this years addiction<br>
Watching you walk out the door<br>
The stench of the last look you gave to me<br>
You're a perfectionist when it comes to it<br>
It saddens me to know you could start a new life<br><br>
Leaving everything behind<br>
Now I am left to pick up the broken pieces<br>
When I never asked to be here in the first place<br>
And it lives with me every day<br>
Down a whore's throat<br>
Runnin' around<br>

Their time is coming to an end<br>

They will not force us<br>
They will stop degrading us<br>
They will not control us<br>
We will be victorious<br>

I'm taking you with me.<br>
<br>
You curse the spot. All you see is the drop.<br>
You're so caught up. I'm treacherous.<br>
<br>
I don't do this for the ones, who suffered at your hands.<br>
I don't do this for their love, it's not what they command.<br>
I do it for myself, I'm here to purge the garden.<br>
<br>
Lead me down to the river. I don't need your permission.<br>
If you wanna play holy, I'll be the snake in the garden.<br>
Blame me for the ills of mankind. I'm not guilty.<br>
You wanna see me swing I'm not guilty.<br>
I'm taking you with me.<br>
You curse the spot. All you see is the drop.<br>
<br>
You curse the spot. I'm not guilty.<br>
I'm taking you with me.<br>
I do this for myself and no one else.</p>

            <p class="lyrics-test-test">I know it well enough.<br>
We are in the death throws.<br>
I have to call you bluff.<br>
You need your direction.<br>
You want a static life. And I'm angry.<br>
You want the same results without the same effects.<br><br>
Repeat a dead science.<br>
You beat the dead carcess.<br>
This is insanity. It's not a plan for me.<br>
You'd have me accept it. Too proud to respect it.<br>
I'll burn this place to the ground.<br>
Irresponsible to throw it away.<br>
Secure it in the cold and decay.<br>
This heart can't cease to beat.<br><br>
I want it to shatter.<br>
A thousand pieces strewn on the floor.<br>
They're all around me.<br>
They will unthaw inspiration.<br>
If this is doomed to fail, I'd rather watch it burn.<br>
I'll watch it burn.<br>
What happened to you to make you bitter?<br>
Too soon to accept that fate.<br>
Too soon to pull the trigger.<br><br>
You keep it secure in the cold.<br>
I want it to shatter.<br>
It's too soon to pull the trigger.<br>
It's too soon to pull the trigger.<br>
What happened to you to make you bitter?<br>
It's too soon to pull the trigger.</p>

            <p class="lyrics-test-test">The static life was not your intention<br>
You want to wear me out and have me accept it<br>
You try to protect yourself I know you hurt someone<br>
I know to play that part I've learned to expect it<br>
It's too soon to pull the trigger<br>
It's too soon to pull the trigger<br>
What happened to you to make you bitter<br>
It's too soon to pull the trigger<br><br>
Secure in the cold... is this what you do<br>
Secure in the cold<br>
If this is doomed to fail than I would rather burn<br>
I would rather burn<br>
I would rather burn<br>
I would rather burn<br><br>
Oh Oh Oh Oh<br>
Oh Oh Oh Oh<br>

If this is doomed to fail than I would rather burn<br>

            <p class="lyrics-test-test">How could every single drop<br>
of consciousness be pushed aside?<br>
Brushed under a paragidm where ignorance is left to thrive.<br>
Five faces.<br><br>
The death of death is vital to the preserver.<br>
Hide your face to take your place inside his realm.<br>
Divine anger.<br>
Five faces.<br>
Buried alive.<br>
The virus of euphoria.<br><br>
Witness declined.<br>
Victourious<br>
Intelligence to finish us.<br>
They know that their right for the wrong way.<br>
Hide your face as you strike a match.<br>
Intelligence is turning to ash.<br><br>
The truth is, you are the assailant.<br>
Decimate them all.<br>
Ignite the stake to burn them all.<br>
If their minds have awakened.</p>

            <p class="lyrics-test-test">Was it an act of God that erased our humanity?<br>
You're either dying or you're dead and alone.<br>
I embrace the insanity.<br>
The place where you made your stand.<br>
It never mattered to them.<br>
The man in black transforms us.<br>
It never mattered to the hand.<br>
The place where you made your stand.<br><br>
It never mattered to the hand of God.<br>
I'm thinking in the end. It might be better.<br>
Can we transcend war with ourselves<br><br>
If we think our Hell is Heaven?<br>
I'm thinking in the end it might be better.<br>
From the hand of God.<br><br>
We are running out of time. A decision must be made.<br>
They might be frayed but they're still detonate the bomb.<br>
The hand of God.<br>
Running out of time.</p>

            <p class="lyrics-test-test">Dying to live, trying to fit narrow<br>
Dying to live the definition.<br>
I won't be conned, I won't be ensnared.<br>
To tell you the truth, you make me sick.<br>
To tell you the truth you still have nothing.<br>
You are violent but I feel nothing.<br>
Your entitlement-<br>
I owe you nothing.<br><br>
I watch you deflate and I see nothing.<br>
You're not my Saviour this time.No.<br>
No point in trying to fix this narrow snare.<br>
You're still slack-jawed, listless and soft.<br>
Man of virtue. I will hurt you.<br>
And my heart is too cold<br>
And I lack a gentle touch<br>
And I do not exist as a constant to your crutch.<br><br>
I disregard your moral failings. If you couldn't get it up.<br>
And my heart is too cold<br>
And I lack the sympathy.<br>
It's too small.<br>
It would split if I would give you what you need.<br>
The constant to your crutch, if you can't get it up.<br>
You're failing.<br><br>
You can't control the clutch.<br>
I lack a tender heart. Can you function with no backbone?<br>
I have no consolation.<br>
I'm running out of patience.<br>
Can't control the clutch.<br>
So soft and slack-jawed.<br>
My conscience is crystal clear.<br>
My conscience is fucking crystal clear.</p>

Realize the faction won.<br>
Your goal is Work.Buy.Die.<br>
Just know I don't want your acceptance or your forgiveness.<br>
I don't want a leader I just need a witness.<br>
We carbon copy for your profit.<br>
We tied our hands in tradition.<br>
Unravel the thread that anchors me.<br>
Deconstruct the fibres that are clinging.<br><br>
You grieve for what's lost.<br>
I grieve for what never was.<br>
It always feels the same.<br>
I want no part.<br>
I know- Produce for yourself alone<br>
That's probably why they hate you the most.<br><br>
Existing to suck you dry<br>
Take away from the host the substance.<br>
You are a resource for them to harness.<br>
I'm opposed to my function.<br>
The veil is not my composition.<br>
Unravel the thread that anchors me.<br><br>
Deconstruct the fibres that are clinging.<br>
In the chronicle you were a sentence.<br>
Destroy the archive let them rebuild.<br>
I don't need a leader I just need a witness.<br>
I am opposed to my function.<br>
Cut out the thread.<br><br>
Done with antiquity in a dying system.<br>
The scene. It had no love for me.<br>
I don't exist in life a drone to Work.Buy.Die.<br>
Believe in anything.<br>

Work.Buy.Die.</p>

            <p class="lyrics-test-test">I heard you could walk on water.<br>
I watch you play victim to the tombs.<br>
Slaughter of a filthy pig.<br>
I'd watch your skin turn on the spit.<br><br>
But I would not consume. I won't infect my body.<br>
Syllables invite you to your tomb.<br>
Favor taken.-service<br>
To rip out the tongue.<br><br>
Let them suffer. Aware if their miserable lives.<br>
Restore balance and move on.<br>
You grow submissive.Unbearable.<br>
I don't do this for justice.<br>
The look in your eyes as we consume you.<br><br>
Wade in the water. A beast to slaughter.<br>
Wade in the weight. The water.<br>
A beast to slaughter.<br><br>
I'd gladly watch your skin turning on.<br>
I know you're seeing this through. On the back end.<br>
Set in your conviction. Are you?<br>
I heard you could walk on water.<br>
The flesh is rotten. Burn till it's forgotten.

No reason to stand in the doorway.<br><br>
It's been so long since we've had a visitor.<br>
A room with no number and no name.<br>
So long since we've fed off the innocent.<br>
Put your hands on the barrier.<br>
The imprint of the blood is your hands on the barrier.<br>
The imprint of the blood is there.<br><br>
When you first walked in it was holding you back.<br>
It was my hand, I was holding you back.<br>
Innocent is better when it's dead.<br>
And my death is better when it's fed.<br>
We all float here.<br>
We're still floating. We all float down here.<br>
No reason to stand in the doorway.<br>
It's been so long since we've had a visitor.<br><br>
A room with no number and no name.<br>
It's been so long since we've fed off the innocent.<br>
Put your hands on the barrier.<br>
The imprint of the blood is in your hands on the barrier.<br>
The imprint of of the blood is there.</p>

            <p class="lyrics-test-test">When I was young I was taught God.<br>
They equated their fear with a real love.<br>
In time the dissonance becomes believable.<br>
It is a constant reminder<br>
That it grows.<br>
My whole life.<br><br>
A toxic shadow stays with me at the seams.<br>
And I know it's insidious.<br>
In the light still the outline stays with me at the seams.<br>
And I know it's insidious.<br>
You're fear is not enough.<br>
It's cheap and it's meaningless.<br>
The doubt has cast a shadow. Eroding my mind.<br><br>
They treat it like a sickness.<br>
They fear I am not contagious.<br>
Realize your God is too small.<br>
See the outline grow.<br>
The flower is in bloom.<br><br>
I see it underneath. A shadow sings to me that it grows.<br>
My whole life. A toxic shadow stays with me at the seams.<br>
And I know it's insidious.<br>
In the light still the outline stays with me at the seams.<br>
And I know it's insidious.<br>
Rip out all the seams. Let it breathe.<br>
Fear is not the same thing.<br>
Your God is too small.<br>
There's blood on the pages, right where his name is.</p>
