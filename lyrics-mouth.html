      <p class="lyrics-test-test">This is my grave this is my gate<br>
this is a gun to my head<br>
This is my long walk home from hell<br>
This is my death bed<br>
Put me in the ground and send my flesh to hell<br>
A casket for this skin that's plagued in filth<br>
</p>

      <h1 id="f2" class="lyrics-test">-Uprooted-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">This is my life<br>
I will live it to the fullest, just try and stop me<br>
I'm not wasting my time<br>
I've been given a purpose, I will not let it die<br>
<br>
I will not change for you, that doesn't mean that I'm not changing<br>
I'm growing into the man that I was born to be<br>
I'm chasing my dreams<br>
I am living<br>
I follow my convictions<br>
This is my passion<br>
<br>
9-5 never cut it for me this is life and I intend on living<br>
You can try to say I'm wasting my time but just because<br>
I'm not you doesn't mean that you're right<br>
I am convinced<br>
We're so consumed with life, we've forgotten how to live<br>
<br>
Don't hold me back<br>
Cause I am trying to live my life the way I should<br>
It won't make sense to you<br>
And I doubt it ever could<br>
This is the path for me, the only one I've ever known<br>
And even if you're not by my side I am never alone<br>
<br>
When will you see that this is the life for me<br>
I will not conform to your way of living<br>
You've made your bed so you could dream<br>
But I've turned my dreams into reality<br>
<br>
I am not alone<br>
We are alive, and we will not be stopped<br>
I am not alone<br>
We are alive, and we will not be stopped

      <p class="lyrics-test-test">Let's go back, back to the days<br>
when I was young, when I was just a child<br>
Before everything got tough and life was care free<br>
I wish I could take you there,<br>
back to the good old days. What happened to our family?<br>
<br>
Now I am afraid that things won't ever be the same<br>
<br>
If I could be half the man that you are<br>
I'd have no fear in me at all<br>
If I could be half the man that you are<br>
I'd be just fine and be filled with strength to stand tall<br>
<br>
You've shown me how to be a man<br>
<br>
There will never come a time when I am done learning<br>
I just want to make you proud of me<br>
<br>
It breaks my heart when I see you hurting,<br>
I just want to you to be healed<br>
I will never stop praying for restoration<br>
You've poured your life out for me and my brothers alike<br>
It's honor to call you father and to have been raised by your side<br>
<br>
I wish that I could change things for you<br>
Give back to the man who's given everything<br>
I wish that I could change things for you<br>
And show you how much you mean to me<br>
<br>
You've shown me how to be a man<br>
<br>
If I could take away your pain, I swear I'd give you my heart<br>
You given everything I could ask for nothing more</p>

      <h1 id="f4" class="lyrics-test">-Whanau-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">hat have you gotten yourself into now?<br>
Living behind bars you've thrown away your crown.<br>
Brother is a funny word for someone like you<br>
but the blood that's in my veins is in your<br>
veins and I swear I'll pull you through<br>
<br>
Look at this life you threw away do you even<br>
know what it's worth?<br>
When I look into your eyes<br>
I can see all the pain, I can see all the hurt<br>
You've run away before but you don't know what<br>
you're running from.<br>
You're going in circles back to where you begun.<br>
If you could see through your eyes without<br>
the glaze and without the high<br>
you would see that it killed me watching you die.<br>
<br>
I watched you die<br>
And now we can't ever go back to the days<br>
when you were the only one that<br>
kept my head on straight<br>
<br>
This is what family is for<br>
Don't you forget that I will stand by you to the grave<br>
<br>
This is what family is for<br>
<br>
Oh brave climber (oh, brave climber)<br>
has this mountain conquered you?<br>
Or will you find the strength to<br>
live the life that God intended you to lead?<br>
Do you remember (do you remember)<br>
that I still look up to you?<br>
And I will be your strength till<br>
there is nothing left in me.<br>
(2nd time= "please remember")<br>
<br>
Brother I swear I'll pull you through<br>
This is not the end of you<br>
<br>
Was heaven not enough, you had to dive into hell?<br>
I know you're searching for a cure but God is not in that needle<br>
Was heaven not enough for you?</p>

      <h1 id="f5" class="lyrics-test">-Monologue-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">So here we are again, miles apart<br>
because I'm stuck in this depression that<br>
feels like possession because the progression<br>
of my transgressions led to an<br>
obsession with digression.<br>
So here is my confession.<br>
<br>
I don't grow I just regress<br>
Cause I've got this heart full of regret<br>
And the pain keeps seeping in<br>
Now my foundation is a mess Cause when<br>
I sit inside this house it never feels<br>
like it's my home.<br>
I am crashing and I am sinking<br>
and I don't wanna go down alone.<br>
<br>
So speak to me<br>
I'm sick of talking to these walls. Can you even hear me?<br>
<br>
What if I said I don't believe in you?<br>
Would we at least be making progress?<br>
You said luke-warm and you would spit me out<br>
Well I tried to be on fire, but these waves have snuffed me out<br>
<br>
I'm washed up on this stage screaming at<br>
the heavens up above me.<br>
I'm weak and unashamed cause I've got nothing left to lose<br>
If this is what it takes to be alive<br>
then I'll scream until my heart is beating<br>
I'm afraid to die,<br>
cause I know I'm so far away from you<br>
<br>
It's not that I'm lost, it's just<br>
that I can't seem to find the strength<br>
to carry on, to carry on one more day.<br>
I know the way, it's been engraved in my head.<br>
But what was supposed to make me alive has<br>
left me feeling dead.<br>
It's time to come clean so here is the honest<br>
truth. I've let my emotion take the place of you.<br>
<br>
Give it time give it time.<br>
I've heard it all before.<br>
But I've been waiting for so long.<br>
Give me something more than an unbelieving<br>
heart and malcontent.<br>
I'm desperate for the strength<br>
to say "I was born for this"<br>
<br>
When did emotion become my reality?<br>
I've tried and I've tried to be<br>
the man that you made me to be.<br>
My flesh is weary and my spirit is dead,<br>
I've got so many questions,<br>
get them out of my head!<br>
<br>
Where were you when my walls came crashing in?<br>
Where were you when she walked away<br>
never to come back again? Were you<br>
asleep when my heart turned to<br>
stone and sunk me into this sea?<br>
Where were you? God, where are you?<br>
Take me back to when I was young (take me back)<br>
I want to feel alive again<br>
I want to love you like I once did

      <h1 id="f6" class="lyrics-test">-Part Two-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">Right by your side,<br>
before you were birthed into this life.<br>
I've been right here with open ears<br>
Was I asleep?<br>
I will never rest,<br>
I will never rest until you know that I am<br>
for you not against you and I will never let you go<br>
I know, I know, I know that you are hurting<br>
Just know, just know, just know I can feel your pain<br>
I've been here the entire time<br>
With open arms screaming out your name<br>
<br>
I never wanted it to be like this<br>
But you have to understand<br>
I've got you right in the palm of my hands<br>
Run to me with your broken legs<br>
I'll take your mangled<br>
bones and teach you how to stand<br>
<br>
I look back, I look back on all the things<br>
you've seen and it breaks my heart<br>
But don't forget,<br>
don't forget your pain was nailed to me<br>
Lay your burdens down at the foot the cross<br>
<br>
When you run away I will chase you<br>
In your darkest days you cannot hide from me<br>
<br>
I can see in the dark<br>
I can see in the dark<br>
I can see in the dark<br>
I can see in the dark, come back to me<br>
<br>
I can see it in your eyes that your dead<br>
But I can bring you back to life,<br>
I can bring you back to life<br>
I can see it in your eyes that your searching<br>
I can be your light, I can be your light<br>
Come back to me, I will set you free,<br>
take away your shame and seat you among kings<br>
Open your eyes, I'm right by your side<br>
With outstretched hands screaming, "here am I!"</p>

so sick of this complacency and the apathy of my heart<br>
Im stuck with paralytic tendencies<br>
This passivity has torn me apart<br>
<br>
I am trying to find my way back home<br>
But I've had a hard time with these dry and weary bones<br>
I am a Pharisee by definition<br>
Far too proud to admit when I am wrong<br>
I am a plague to my own existence<br>
I'm killing myself with this repetitious sin<br>
I am a hypocrite!<br>
Wash me clean I am so desperate to be free<br>
<br>
Set me free<br>
It's time I called you out<br>
For all pain and death that you have caused<br>
No more holding back<br>
I've drawn my line I won't back down<br>
This is the end of you<br>
No longer a thorn in my side<br>
This is the end of you<br>
I'm taking back my life<br>
<br>
Rid me of myself<br>
<br>
Cycle endless cycle, when will my<br>
hands be clean when will I be set free<br>
I've been asleep all these years<br>
with open eyes it's time I wake up<br>
<br>
And separate myself from all this pain<br>
You and I are not the same<br>
Im sick of always feeling like I'm weak<br>
God, set me free<br>
<br>
So here we are, me myself and<br>
I but your voice is in my head<br>
I've got nothing left to lose<br>
cause I'm already dead<br>
God, put me to sleep.<br>
Put me to sleep, oh God.<br>
Put me to sleep.<br>
Put an end to my depravity.<br>
<br>
And at the end of it all I<br>
look back on everything that have made me fall<br>
Now there's only one thing left to say<br>
This is my life... And this time I choose to walk away</p>

it wasn’t ever meant to be.<br>
I’m still searching. I’m still searching.<br>
I’ve been held back, I’ve been shut down but I am not dead yet.<br>
I’m still swinging and I’m still holding on to hope.<br>
I’ve been clinging to the edge with just my<br>
fingertips and I’ve been praying to God,<br>
don’t let me lose my grip.<br>
<br>
I will not fall. I will never compromise my faith.<br>
I’m holding firmly to the truth and I will not back down.<br>
This life has drained me dry and though<br>
my flesh is weak and broken my soul will never die.<br>
<br>
I will not settle for what this world has.<br>
I’ve danced with the devil in hell and I will not go back.<br>
I’ve found myself in the one who calls me son.<br>
Take me home, God, let your kingdom come.<br>
<br>
This place is not my home I was born for the less traveled road.<br>
I’ve got a lot of growing left to do<br>
but I swear that I will see this through.<br>
<br>
I’ve felt the weight of the world crash down on me.<br>
I’ve been to hell and back and I’m still breathing<br>
I’ve screamed my lungs out and<br>
displayed my flaws but I find rest in the arms of God.<br>
No roots no place to call home.<br>
I’m a wanderer, vagabond; I’m bread for the road.<br>
No roots no place to call home.<br>

I am so sick of this cycle, there must be something more<br>

This is endless<br>

This is everything I never wanted it to be<br>
This is hell<br>
This can't be happening<br>
I'm a failure, I'm a liar, I'm a hypocrite<br>
I am not who I claim to be<br>

I could never turn my back on you<br>
Grace like an ocean, I am lost in the depths of your truth<br>
You have seen my heart and the wicked things I've done<br>
And yet you call me "son"<br>
<br>
This is my awakening, and my call to arms<br>
<br>
Show me this world through the holes in your hands<br>
<br>
I'm alive, I'm alive, I have been set free<br>
I was blind but now my eyes are open, I can see I am flawed,<br>
I am flawed, but You have made me clean<br>
I know I'm not perfect but I serve a perfect king<br>

I am nothing<br>
You are everything<br>
Let this truth resonate in my soul<br>
Take my life God, I give you control I have stumbled,<br>
I have fallen,<br>
I've grown weary,<br>
and yet I'm still walking<br>
I've been stuck here with all these questions inside my head<br>
But I will never forget the words that you have said<br>
<br>
"You are the child of the king you have been set free.<br>
There is nothing that can separate you from me.<br>
I am the one that calls you son,<br>
I formed you in the womb,<br>
I conquered the grave,<br>
your home is not a tomb."<br>
<br>
God this just can't be,<br>
I'm so unworthy but your grace has<br>
washed me clean and now I'm learning<br>
that you’re changing everything and I<br>
am not the same, you made everything change...<br>
<br>
When you called my name my heart<br>
stopped and our pulse became the same<br>
When you calmed my soul<br>
 felt the earth shake and the mountains tremble<br>
When you called my name I finally came alive again<br>
When you call me son,<br>
I feel your blood in my veins and your breath in my lungs<br>
When you call my name</p>

Will you be the one to break the silence?<br>
And not settle for positivity just to spare an offense<br>

separate the goats from the sheep!<br>
Your fear of man is a cop-out,<br>
it has nothing do with what you perceive others to see.<br>
Your tongue is a rudder, but you lack<br>
passion for the sea.<br>
So what comes out is drought<br>
soaking moisture from dessert air,<br>
hanging dry,<br>

I've been falling short and burning out; your patience must be thin<br>
Have I worn out your patience yet?

        <p class="lyrics-test-test">[feat. Brother Friend]<br>
<br>
O little man, what know you of our patience?<br>
Talk to us about time as if you know I AM, the one who made it<br>
Talk to us about pain as if you know I AM, the one who laid it<br>
All down for you at the crown of the place, stripped of its flesh,<br>
The hill without a face, to give you a foundation of mercy<br>
To carve into your hands, valleys for our grace.<br>
We can see that you are hurting,<br>
Suffocating in your tightly woven mask.<br>
It’s enough to keep you breathing, but not near enough to last<br>
If you keep asking all these questions<br>
One of you will die of asphyxiation<br>
You lead a double life, and only do half the living.<br>
<br>
We said to be like Christ, you cannot be like the trinity.<br>
Of a single mind, yet thrice, you've not uncovered that mystery<br>
Only we can be three in one without anything spilling<br>
Where we do not absolutely intend it to be.<br>
<br>
So have you started reaching for the ties behind your head?<br>
Or do your fingers fumble scratching your eyes out instead?<br>
Have you learned nothing? O man, listen to what we said!<br>
Trade your trying for trusting, and let us do the rest.<br>
<br>
And just so you know we intend to spill all over creation<br>
But for some reason you are not making the connection<br>
That includes you<br>
Which of our actions has ever led you to believe<br>
Our intentions are to exclude?<br>
What makes you think that we exude anything other<br>
than unmerited favor toward the entirety of your endeavors?<br>
Historically, when have we ever proved to be anything less<br>
than your forever victorious Savior?<br>
Was it the beginning when we made man in our likeness?<br>
Or on the ark of Noah when we saved you from the torrents?<br>
Perhaps it was when we promised the land of milk and honey?<br>
Or delivered you from your enemies and closed on them, the sea?<br>
<br>
And you ask for your chains back! You have loved a new slavery!<br>
No matter how much you nag, we will not place you on that tree!<br>
You cannot sacrifice your words and acts!<br>
You cannot convince us of your piety!<br>
You can be still, relax, let us sing to you our poetry.<br>
We could speak in the way you ask,<br>
but what would you hear more audibly?<br>
<br>
Have you started reaching for the ties behind your head?<br>
Or do your fingers fumble scratching your eyes out instead?<br>
Have you learned nothing? O man, listen to what we said!<br>
Trade your trying for trusting, and let us do the rest.<br>
<br>
I will condescend my finger tip<br>
To graciously fold your hip<br>
You have fought for long enough<br>
I see your seam starting to rip<br>
Let me cut the strings for you strung<br>
Stretching from the corners of your lips<br>
And separate the plastic grafted<br>
To your cheeks, ears, nose, and chin<br>
It will hurt at first, but trust me,<br>
Your flesh must be stripped<br>
Be ready with the oil<br>
and keep your lamp wick well trimmed<br>
Wait for me eagerly, I will send the second skin<br>
You knot this thing thoroughly,<br>
But it is not a match for the One who<br>
will undo all the damage that you did<br>
He will take the hewn with open wounds and<br>
sew your folds back into Him<br>
Your tattered attempts to mend the holes<br>
will soon hold inside the hem of his robe<br>
made white by his life,<br>
red in his death,<br>
whole at moment I chose to resurrect,<br>
then yours the second you accept<br>
that I want nothing less than the best<br>
for all my elect.<br>
I have the authority to command<br>
and the power to affect,<br>
The strength to defend,<br>
The compassion to protect<br>
You work futility to its end<br>
And forsake the day of rest<br>
But when you grow tired again<br>
I will be there to help you unforget...<br>
<br>
It's my hands that formed you out of clay<br>
(It’s your hands that formed me from the clay)<br>
It's my hands that lavish you with love and grace<br>
(Those same hands are filled with love and grace)<br>
My hands were held by nails to the tree<br>
(It’s your hands held by nails up on that tree)<br>
It's my hands that will bring you back to me<br>
(Those same hands are reaching toward me)</p>

        <h1 id="s6" class="lyrics-test">-Idle Hands-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Comfortable and poised<br>
We sit on our thrones, we sit on our hands and we let them die<br>
We’re all too blind, we’re blinded by our American eyes<br>
I will not, I will not be idle<br>
(Stretch out your hands)<br>
<br>
Living in a new perspective<br>
Everything I once held close I count it all as lost<br>
What is life lived selfishly when nothing goes with me?<br>
Hollow and empty.<br>
My hands cling far too tight to the things of this life,<br>
I’m finally letting go<br>
<br>
What is life lived selfishly?<br>
<br>
Rip out my eyes cause I don’t see right<br>
Selfish and blind to my pride I am my own disease<br>
<br>
Hollow and empty<br>
I can take nothing with me<br>
Hollow and empty<br>
I’ve served myself and hordes the rest<br>
<br>
Life is more fulfilling when you put yourself last<br>
I have learned this the hard way all of my life<br>
I’ve been given more than enough its time I give back<br>
<br>
Servant of all<br>
<br>
Idle hands murder the helpless<br>
Let these words end the silence<br>
Stretch out your hands<br>
<br>
I never wanted to come to this<br>
End my pride and my selfishness<br>
I will not, I will not be idle<br>
(I refuse, I refuse)<br>
<br>
Living in a new perspective<br>
Everything I once held close I count it all as lost<br>
What is life lived selfishly when nothing goes with me?<br>
Hollow and empty.<br>
My hands cling far too tight to the things of this life,<br>
I’m finally letting go

<br>
I know this has come back to me<br>
I opened the doors that have led me here<br>
Face to face with the devil<br>
I've been fighting these demons for the last few years<br>
<br>
I’ve grown weary<br>
Struck down and worn out<br>
Turn the page once more<br>
I placed myself here<br>
<br>
I let them lead me to the slaughter<br>
Step by step into this living hell<br>
I let them slide the noose around my neck<br>
When they chained me I sat still<br>
<br>
Dancing with the devil I am plagued with disease<br>
Fill my veins with your blood, spark my pulse into a beat<br>
<br>
Purge this poison from my veins<br>
I’m calling them out<br>
Every demon that I’ve faced,<br>
every devil that’s held me down<br>
I'll spew you because I’m tired of being warm<br>
And my home is not this storm<br>
<br>
I’m through with you<br>
No more darkness, no more shame<br>
Turn on the lights, give you no place to remain<br>
Your hold on me is no longer here<br>
<br>
“Have you forgotten that I dwell<br>
in the depths of your dark and filthy heart?<br>
I did not merely force my way in,<br>
I found an open door.<br>
I left and came back to discover your hollow veins,<br>
so I made my home. I know everything about you,<br>
I know everything about you.<br>
I know<br>
your secrets and the things you<br>
do when you think your alone.<br>
I live in the shadows you create;<br>
you’ve made this place into my home.”<br>
<br>
I let them lead me to the slaughter<br>
Step by step into this living hell<br>
But as I cry out to my Father<br>
My strength begins to swell<br>
<br>
Your lies are replaced with the truth<br>
This heart was never mine to give<br>
I may have opened the doors<br>
But now I choose to live<br>
<br>
Dancing with the devil I’ve been plagued with disease<br>
You’ve filled my veins with your blood,<br>
sparked my pulse into a beat<br>
<br>
Bind the host, shine your light,<br>
give them no places to hide<br>
<br>
Go to hell, dark passenger<br>
Back to where you came from<br>
Go to hell, dark passenger<br>
I stand with heaven as a child of the king<br>
Go to hell.

        <p class="lyrics-test-test">You can gauge out my eyes<br>
But I’ve already seen enough to last a life time<br>
You can cut off my hands<br>
But I'm a thief at heart and I know I'll steal again<br>
No more innuendos<br>
No more hiding my face<br>
The truth is that I keep looking at<br>
your daughters the wrong way<br>
Sever my flesh from me<br>
<br>
I can’t stop tossing and turning<br>
Reliving the regrets that I can’t seem to forget<br>
Wipe the slate clean; I want to be set free<br>
I believed a lie; this is not me<br>
<br>
My fantasies are built on things I was never meant to see<br>
I’ve turned into the man that I was never meant to be<br>
God knows I tried but the devil whispered<br>
lies and I believed; I believed<br>
(This is not me)<br>
<br>
I believed a lie<br>
I believed a lie<br>
My flesh knows the way back to her door<br>
And no matter how strong my heart<br>
is I keep going back for more<br>
Going back for more<br>
I believed a lie<br>
<br>
Replace these lies with the truth<br>
I want to see the right way<br>
Replace these lies with the truth<br>
I am not my mistakes<br>

I am not my mistakes

<br>
You've gone too far now<br>
I saw the tide swell<br>
Violent, pulling at your feet<br>
Now the currents pulling you under<br>
I watched you sink<br>
Past the point of turning back<br>
No sense of direction<br>
No evidence of conviction<br>
I can see through your masks<br>
I see the pain that you feel<br>
Was your faith ever real?<br>
Because I swear it was<br>
<br>
What made you turn your back on the God<br>
who was so present in your past<br>
Where are your monuments?<br>
Where are all your reminders?<br>
How could you forget what he has done?<br>
<br>
I wish I could understand<br>
And take away what's caused you pain<br>
If I could I would bear it myself<br>
I would remove what made you hurt<br>
Let it burn in hell<br>
If I could I would take your place<br>
I would carry your burdens<br>
All the way to my grave<br>
<br>
You are not alone<br>
And you never were<br>
<br>
You uprooted from the soil you once knew<br>
And sought growth in the thorns<br>
No roots will survive in the shallows<br>
Now you're drowning in scorn<br>
<br>
It's not my goal to cure you<br>
I'm far too weak to do that on my own<br>
But with everything I am I will do my<br>
best to point you back home<br>
<br>
Hear the call<br>
<br>
I want you to know that I'm right here<br>
I want you to know I'm not going anywhere<br>
<br>
(I want you to know you're not alone)<br>
I will never give up, I will never stop<br>
I will fight for you even with nothing left<br>
So never give up, and never give in<br>
When you fall down I will pick you up again<br>
It breaks my heart to see you like this<br>
<br>
Here you are<br>
No strength to stand<br>
You gave up everything<br>
You let go of his hand<br>
(When you let go of his hand)<br>
Here the call

        <p class="lyrics-test-test">I’ll shrink myself so that<br>
everyone can see<br>
Past the doubt and know that<br>
this is not about me<br>
<br>
I was born into a world of sin in a universe of grace<br>
All my struggles have been shaping and changing me<br>
And reforming my face<br>
<br>
I don’t want to be a better version of me<br>
Just to feed my vanity<br>
Change my name to the one that conquers graves<br>
Make me more like you<br>
<br>
I am nothing without grace<br>
(Flowing through my veins)<br>
I am nothing without grace<br>
Everything I have has been given to me<br>
<br>
My path has not led me here to exalt my own name<br>
If I put myself on the pedestal this<br>
will have all been in vain<br>
<br>
I’ve got a novels worth of testimony<br>
infused within these notes<br>
And I’ll spill my guts until the day I<br>
die just to bring an ounce of hope<br>
<br>
This is not about me<br>
This is not about mev
No man can ever attain to the power of<br>
the cross; the name above all names<br>
There’s a lot for me to learn and I don’t<br>
have all the answers<br>
But I know enough to know that I am only<br>
here because he conquered death<br>
<br>
I know there’s beauty in the desert and<br>
there’s glory in the storm<br>
So I’ll keep my hands stretched to the sky<br>
and wait for the son to make me warm<br>
<br>
I am nothing without grace<br>
(Flowing through my veins)<br>
I am nothing without grace<br>
Everything I have has been given to me
