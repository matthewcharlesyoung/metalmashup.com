      <p class="lyrics-test-test">I've been watching your progress<br>
You wouldn't know because I'm on the other side of the mirror<br>
Observing you as you paint your reflection<br>
<br>
Have you ever felt my touch as you sleep?<br>
Or hear the sound of my footsteps as the floorboards creek?<br>
Do you feel alone or do you feel like something is there?<br>
It wasn't the wind that caressed your hair<br>
<br>
You can lie to yourself but you can't lie to me<br>
As I look through the glass all your thoughts can be seen<br>
When you bow your head at night and bleed into a prayer<br>
I am the only one who can hear<br>
So close yet so far<br><br>

I've been watching your progress<br>
You wouldn't know because I'm on the other side of the mirror<br>
Observing you as you paint your reflection<br><br>

You can lie to yourself but you can't lie to me<br>
As I look through the glass all your thoughts can be seen<br>
When you bow your head at night and bleed into a prayer<br>
I am the only one who can hear<br>
You are not alone<br><br>

Hold your breath on the way down<br>
With every shallow breath you begin to drown<br>
Swallow the blood, swim for air</p>

Reality is shedding her skin,<br>
slipping out of her dress with a sadistic grin<br>
Feet flat on the floor,<br>
clawing at the rusted hinges of the door<br>
Pitch black eyes, baptized in flies, ordained to suffer<br>
<br>
The deceased lay scattered across the pavement,<br>
their rotting flesh drips off their splintered bones<br>
Decomposing smiles light up the room, allowing the maggots to bloom<br>
Slithering up my spine, my veins are turning black<br>
Death stares me in the eyes and tells me my life was a lie<br>
<br>
Manifesting before me,<br>
materializing in front of my eyes,<br>
the omnipresent God<br>

We are legion,<br>
for we are many<br>
We are legion,<br>

scribing the words of lord across the wall<br>
Holy scriptures adorned in the essence<br>
of death to be reborn and given breath<br>
You will be reborn and given breath<br>
<br>
Emanating from darkness, in darkness is truth<br>
You will find your forgiveness hanging<br>
from the end of your bed sheet noose<br>
<br>
Kick the chair, say a prayer,<br>
let him know of your despair<br>
In the end god never cared,<br>
how does it feel to be forsaken?</p>

looking in.<br>
A black widow crawls out of my mouth and down my bloody chin.<br>
I am suspended with bed sheets constricting my throat.<br>
Hanging from the bars in the window, watching myself decompose.<br><br>
Perception without confinement, distorted interpretations.<br>
Washed away by the blood that runs from my flesh,<br>
a vision of death.<br><br>
What I saw through the eyes of my flesh,<br>
just a glimpse of what lies beneath the surface.<br>
I can see through the blindfold,<br>
shedding light on the lies that my eyes told.<br>
Death embraces me tighter than my life ever did,<br>
cradling my weary soul.<br>
Filling the void, filling the hole.<br><br>
I always had that feeling in the back of my head,<br>
the feeling that I would be better off dead.<br>
No home, nowhere to go, only an empty world to roam.<br>
So desolate and cold, I am alone.<br>
Bloated and rotting, the rats feed on my flesh.<br>
To them I leave my inheritance.<br>
They digest and shit me out,<br>
returning my flesh to the earth.<br>
Returning my flesh to the earth,<br>
bloated and rotting.</p>

murmuring a prayer in dread.<br>
Either there is no god or god is dead,<br>
was this all part of the plan?<br>
To leave me here, amid the vultures?<br>
Picking out the eyes of a broken man?<br>
They think they're better than me,<br>
so afraid of heresy.<br><br>
Eradicating every divergent strand until<br>
they come together and make a stand.<br>
We stand on the earth divided,<br>
we cannot resist, we cannot fight it.<br>
Guided by the light of desire.<br>
We cannot resist, we cannot fight it.<br>
The vultures perch on my chest,<br>
tearing my flesh, using my bones to make a nest.<br>
They think that they follow a leader,<br>
on their knees, sucking the dick of the reaper.<br><br>
Feeding them lies as he shoots his load into their eyes.<br>
They’re always begging for more,<br>
slurping up the cum like worthless whores.<br>
Guided by the light of desire,<br>
fearing the kiss of a corrosive fire.<br>
Rip out my tainted eyes,<br>
feed upon my skin.<br>
Regurgitate my flesh into your children's mouths,<br>
regurgitate my flesh.<br>
I'm the food for the new generation,<br>
the new generation.

Hypnotized by the lies that drown out the truth,<br>

Mesmerized by the flies digesting decay,<br>

You will never be beautiful,<br><br>
you will never be beautiful to me. What a disgrace.<br>
They perceive the world as it's played out to be,<br>

sending the children into wars.<br><br>
Hypnotized by the lies that drown out the truth,<br>
parents still think that they're raising the youth.<br>
Mesmerized by the flies digesting decay,<br>
consuming the light of day.<br><br>

Bow before me, the bellowing beast.<br>
Arise and worship, I the porcelain whore<br>.
Your artificial idol in this materialistic society.<br>
A nation of confusion,<br>
overwhelmed in narcissistic decomposition.</p>

Your body will rot<br>
Pretending you're asleep beneath the earth,<br>

Lifting up the sheet for the coroner,<br>
I can't recognize you anymore<br>
But I still think that you're gorgeous,<br>

Your reconstructed face.<br>
Pity, such beauty went to a putrid waste<br>

The tracks of stitches running underneath your blouse<br>
I hope that you're watching this<br><br>
as I give you one last kiss farewell,<br>
we’ll meet again in hell<br>
No matter how deep you fall,<br>
I will hear your call.<br>
Nothing can stand between us nothing at all<br>
Burning slowly forever,<br>
at least we're together,<br>
hold my hand and close your eyes<br>
Don't be afraid, everyone dies,<br><br>
your body will rot<br>
Pretending you're asleep beneath the earth,<br>

The electric current flows through the twisted wires<br>
A pungent smell of burnt skin enters my nostrils<br>
The convulsing begins<br>

You cry out to God<br>
I am your God now<br>

I peel back your eyelids then force my fingers in<br>
Between your eyes & their sockets<br>

I shove them further<br>
Driving them through the thin layer of bone<br>
Perforating & severing your cerebral cortex<br>

You can feel the pain even through your comatic state<br>
Black & bruised<br>
Discharging ooze<br>

Intertwining our sentience<br>

with no one else but yourself to blame<br><br>
You can't remember the good but you remember the pain<br>
Standing behind the mirror,<br><br>

Desperately wishing that it would stay.<br>
I know that you’re watching,<br>

Probing deeper into the physical realm<br>

Unlocking a gateway to Hell<br>

Completing a sacred crest<br>
Blackened shadows pierce you like arrows<br>
Filling the void in your severed chest<br>

Stitch by stitch<br>
I sew up the wound<br>
Containing the darkness<br>
That dwells within<br>

Unworldly we are true Gods restrained to covet the human flesh<br>
Fear my touch<br>

Relapse in obedience<br>
Allow me to molest your psyche<br>
Penetrating this shallow womb called a body<br>

You judge me. Take a look in the mirror.<br>
Is the image becoming clearer?<br>
Look yourself in the eyes.<br>
Look past the barrier of lies.<br>
Do you see the devil in your eyes?<br>
Do you see your fate?</p>

        <h1 id="s10" class="lyrics-test">-Deflesh To Unveil-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">eneath my skin.<br>
I feel the hatred that burns within.<br>
Everything that I've ever loved has been taken from me again.<br>
I can never forgive this world.<br>
Not until it gives me what I am owed.<br>
I walk through this world alone.<br>
Scars so deep they run straight to the bone.<br>
This flesh is weak.<br><br>
Serrated teeth cut through my skin to see what's underneath.<br>
Unleash the hatred.<br>
I won't let this life be wasted.<br>
Sitting back while the world crushes me under it's weight.<br>
Letting the fear I have control my destiny.<br>
I won't the victim. I won't be the coward.<br>
I won't hesitate to destroy you in my final hour.<br><br>
I'm sick o bearing the weight on my shoulders,<br>
waiting for something to change.<br>
To no avail, it always remains the same.<br>
I am the only one I can blame.<br>
I am the only one who can change.<br>
I won't be the victim.<br>
I won't be the coward.<br>
I won't hesitate to destroy you in my final hour.<br><br>
I won't hesitate to destroy you in my final hour.<br><br>
This earth belongs to me.<br>
Nothing can stop me.<br>
Decay and erosion.<br>
I am the omen.</p>

        <h1 id="s11" class="lyrics-test">-Father Of Abortion-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Father, forgive them<br>
They know not what they do<br>
If I told you I don't want revenge<br>
This wouldn't be true<br>
As I hang from my cross<br>
I see the hate in their eyes<br>
These children are lost<br><br>
Abort the bastards<br>
Ignore their cries<br>
There is no hope for a world inhabited by humanity<br>
They rule with insanity<br>
They are a plague wasting away<br>
At our integrity of this sacred Earth<br>
Father of abortion, destroy this perversion<br>
Erase what you have conceived<br>
This is the world that I perceive<br>
Father, forgive them<br>
They know not what they do<br>
If I told you I don't want revenge<br>
This wouldn't be true<br>
Smite them, invite them to hang on the cross<br>
With me beneath the blackened sky<br>
Ignore their desperate criesv<br><br>
Father of abortion destroy this perversion<br>
Erase what you have conceived<br>
This is what I perceive<br>
You gave birth to a mistake<br>
You breathed into their lungs<br>
And they mocked you with their deceitful tongues<br>
Creation<br>
Abort this debauched creation</p>

        <h1 id="s12" class="lyrics-test">-Cruciform-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">I spend my last day on earth enjoying the<br>
last bit of beauty it has to offer.<br>
Sitting in the sunlight as the<br>
final nails are hammered into my coffin.<br>
I accept my fate of damnation.<br>
I await it with anticipation.<br><br>
The crows perch on the trees above,<br>
as if they could preconceive the spilling of my blood.<br>
When I look into their faces.<br>
I see the empty spaces.<br>
The crows tore out their eyes.<br>
Torn out before they could die.<br>
My father had prepared a place for me.<br>
Nailed to the wood of a rotting tree.<br><br>
Placed upon my head. A crown of thorns.<br>
All hail the king of the dead.<br>
The fury of god strikes down upon the earth.<br>
Marking the beginning of the planet's rebirth.</p>

        <h1 id="s13" class="lyrics-test">-Deathwind-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">My flesh melts and drips off the bone,<br>
de-fleshing the side of me that I have never shown.<br>
Now you will know what I truly am.<br>
I'm not the man I say I am.<br>
For when I die my body transcends,<br>
with the breath of the wind.<br><br>
My ashes spread like the plague that I am.<br>
I ignite the world in fire and sulfur,<br>
in the names of all those who suffer.<br>
Forged in the flames of damnation.<br>
My gifts of demise is your salvation.<br>
I welcome you to oblivion. You are not alone.<br><br>
Beneath the piles of scorched<br>
flesh and fragmented bones,<br>
new life is seeded.<br>
New life grows.<br><br>
Fertilized by the carbonized waste,<br>
growing through the skulls. New life is embraced.<br>
Fear not the unknown.<br>
The depths of nothingness in which you are thrown.<br>
You are not alone.<br>
Before it gets better, it always gets worse.<br>
This is the way of the universe.<br>
Everyday is a new day.<br><br>
Transcending flesh. Transcending my skin like a serpent.<br>
Death reigns from the sky on the culprit.<br>
Burning in the fire you call out my name.<br>
Withering into dust.<br>
Boiling blood.<br>
I am smiling from above.</p>

        <p class="footer-text article-margin">Here at Metal Mashup you will find a site that celebrates all things heavy and metal. Yet in an effort to move away from the more mainstream aspects of our scene, Metal Mashup has a much-needed focus on the more underground achievements of our community. Don’t get us wrong though, while we all love a bit of Metallica and still lose our shit every time Hetfield sneezes or Lars manages to keep time, we just feel that there is more to our clan that needs to be celebrated.</p>
