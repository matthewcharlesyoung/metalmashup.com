I'm alone, but I make the most of borrowed time.<br>
Forever eternal, the terms of old.<br>
Whispering in secret, they’re questioning it<br>

Who am I<br>
To fight his lighting line of creation?<br>
Who will fight<br>
Foretold ages sent of mystic voices?<br>

Think with your memory<br>
Think for your family<br>
Everything's written for one<br>
Redefine<br>
We'll change everything, I know that we can do this<br>

Hold on a love-line<br>
As all burns<br>
The world bends around me become the tide.<br>
<br>
The devil's deep inside<br>
<br>
I see it as undone<br>
Do what it ever takes<br>
(Taking over)<br>
Let it all go<br>
(Taking over)<br>
Let it all go<br>
You wanna make it, it's already gone awry.<br>
<br>
It's a ring of fire<br>
Through standing this harm, it's already...gone<br>
They'll step on your will,<br>
they'll stand on your faith,<br>
they'll wither you down to nothing and then some.<br>
<br>
It's better to hold deep and stand alone<br>
Having spent this quest without questioning it.<br>
<br>
Who am I<br>
To fight his lighting line of creation?<br>
Who will fight<br>
Foretold ages sent of mystic voices?<br>

Think for your family<br>
Everything's written for one<br>
Redefine<br>
We'll change everything and all that we survive</p>
