And we all know it exists.<br><br>

On that empty street corner I’ll keep walking.<br>

and observe the glowing room<br>
Through the blood that runs through your eyelids,<br>
I guess it’s time to wake<br>
Moving hours with vacant hands just for the chance just to sleep again<br><br>
Drag my feet across the earth yeah I guess that nothings restored<br>
Make my through my designer home<br>
To the heart of my captivity<br>
Where I am both prisoner and warden<br>
All I need is the air inside my lungs, or a cigarette<br>
Life is blank without the flame.<br>
It’s ok cause I am still within the womb<br>
Watching from the inside, the inside<br><br>
The great things wait just past the horizon<br>
They lose their glow when the lights hit their skin<br>
Outstretched hands I’ll flee and to nothing I will open the door.<br>
<br>
The sun is dead, or maybe just fading out<br>
It hits my skin for the first time in days and days<br>
As I slip into the air I feel the warmest winter<br>
That I can remember<br>
Breathless is the empty world<br>
Aimlessly walking through a vacant city<br>
The architecture is all alone<br>
If this is the end I don’t feel a damn thing<br><br>
My tired feet matter no more<br>
It seems the things I tend to believe always fall to my feet<br><br>
To dig my shallow graves<br>
You must have felt this, before you even woke up<br>
You should have known it years ago<br>
Do not be surprised my friend<br>
You make your own decisions<br>
You worked hard, you fought the good fight<br><br>
The taste of copper in a failed mouth full of broken teeth<br>
And the sounds of excusesv
I’ll count my blessings on the fingers of the unbit hand<br>
Empty of reason, goodbyes on the tip of my tongue forever<br>
And so it goes<br>
I must have seen it, before I even woke up<br>
I should have known it years ago<br><br>
I will storm the gates of hell<br>
I will kill the queen of death herself<br>
Shadowless in the last direct light of the drowning sun.</p>

            <p class="lyrics-test-test">Sit and listen to the voices fade<br>
and sing again.<br>
Give them space to destroy it all and build again.<br>
Fill the space with the lies you shed and start again.<br>
Every sorrow, every misery can and will be brought<br>
to life if you put it in a story or a lie.<br>
Every sentence that you<br><br>
recognize. Every word of every kind but I was waking up,<br>
I was strong enough. Every influential interview.<br>
I was in between the lies. But I was waking up,<br>
I am stronger now. Every picture, every photograph,<br>
I was disappearing lines but I was showing<br>
up in the center of life.<br>
Every motion, every point of view:<br>
I was always giving up but I have woken up every time of day.

            <p class="lyrics-test-test">You said love nothing and nothing<br>
that you love can be used against you,<br>
but if you’re trying to save me then you’ll<br>
have to try harder. The sound is an infinite saint<br>
that brings me to its knees. To find my way through space,<br><br>
hurtling like a comet. To find my way through<br>
space. Hey, you’ve fallen on your dreams.<br>
They’re running like a river and sounding<br>
like a stream. We save for opposite ears.<br>
It doesn’t matter what we say. Only diminished<br>
and divorced do we learn to what extent we can love.<br>
What has to, does.</p>

            <p class="lyrics-test-test">If you want to speak to the devil,<br>
you will feel the wave of his or her invented wings.<br>
We see the shadow of the axe before it falls<br>
on the necks of the sheep, but if the light has<br>
a secret shade, I am the lamb that has become the wolf.<br>
One million watts because I’m feeling<br><br>
alive but you’re broken on the inside baby and<br>
that will never have the final say. I feel bad that you’re angry,<br>
but I’m sorry. I don’t care for what<br>
it’s worth and if it ever comes down to me or you,<br>
you’re probably going to die.<br><br>
So take yourself outside and be along to<br>
mediate with a cigarette.<br>
Words of war become acts of war! I’m not fucking around.

            <p class="lyrics-test-test">Someone take me down to the<br>
river and leave no trail for which to return.<br>
Let the muddy water fill my lungs.<br><br>
The invincibility of our youth has just<br>
given way to the inevitability of our death and I hope it does.<br>
So don’t raise your glass. Redemption wears a red dress but<br>
carries a white flag. I’ll wear that red dress for you.<br><br>
The song on the wind is a desperate man’s hymn<br>
and death is a living partner. A consummate, consummate one.<br>

            <p class="lyrics-test-test">Are you feeling alive?<br>
Pace yourself before you run straight into yourself.<br>
You sleep in fragmented glass with reflections of you,<br>
but are you feeling alive? I hope the dead brings the<br><br>
dead and they march across our beds.<br>
I’ve done it before and I rode the horse of death.<br>
So ride the horse of death!<br>
But let me ask you, are you feeling alive?<br>
If the light doesn’t come outside.

            <p class="lyrics-test-test">You’re acting like you<br>
don’t sympathize with anything at all or anyone for any reason.<br>
You’re desperate to fill the space and that makes<br>
me a weight pulling you away. I just made a decision.<br><br>
This condition is only what you made.<br>
Its calling out your name. I just want a<br>
reaction from you. Negatives and positives will drift,<br>
contained on whispered avenues so run,<br>
get out while you can. Break a lot of glass.<br>
Leave the place in shambles. Be careful of what you leave behind.<br><br>
You will walk across companies of friends<br>
and accumulate all the pieces<br>
that you lost. You have to know, I sympathize with you.

            <p class="lyrics-test-test">We don’t need to hash out anything<br>
when your friendship death toll says it all.<br>
It swims like a shark cutting through blood inked waters,<br>
safe from sight.<br>
Clouded in blood and seeking a leg to<br><br>
sink its teeth into.<br>
So sorry to tell you I’m leaving<br>
this sea never to return, and<br>
all of this time I’m just trying to<br>
tell you this one thing. Don’t bring me into this.<br><br>
Please don’t bring me into this. I wish you well.</p>

            <p class="lyrics-test-test">This is a break up scene.<br>
You’re living like a cinematic dream. Just give me a<br>
chance to say everything. You’re not thinking it through at all.<br>
Like you ever saw it coming. This is not an opening.<br>
So just give me a chance to say, we never saw us coming.<br><br>
If you wanted to leave<br><br>
me, all you had to do was ask.<br>
If I want to be the guesser of you.<br>
If you say you’re my darling I’m gonna throw up and die,<br>
if I want to be the guesser of me. Everything is under control.<br>
Does it hurt you to know that it does not hurt me at all?</p>

            <h1 id="ff12" class="lyrics-test">-A Thousand Years A Minute-</h1>
            <p class="lyrics-test-test">I am just a sensory of what<br>
I’ve said and done. This is what I tell myself<br>
to pacify the room. “I suppose living like this is good to?”<br>
I’m taking what you’re giving but the giving takes away.<br>
Is that what you came for? I should really<br>
go backwards like you do. If I wanted to<br><br>
start over again but I don’t<br>
want to be like you, like you do.<br>
I don’t want to embrace my ghosts again.<br>
Once, twice and every desperate time.<br>
So you want to live. So you wanted to die.<br><br>
It that what you came for?<br>
Try not to fall into the dark again.
Try.</p>

            <p class="lyrics-test-test">We’ve all heard them all<br>
say “It takes one to know one”<br>
well small lies are big lies and we’ve all told both.<br>
The whole world is wounded while you stand around<br>
and heal like an angel. You might think all<br>
of this sounds so crazy but we want<br>
to fall where there are padded<br>
walls.<br>
I don’t to be inside while the walls are closing in.<br>
if you want to make this all work then<br>
you’re gonna have to try. One word said softly<br>
and perseverant is the twin of an outright speech<br>
but lies travel faster than the truth is said.</p>
