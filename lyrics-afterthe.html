A part of me that will never leave<br>
Just to remind me of who I have grown to be<br>
Pulling me side to side<br>
It won't forget me<br><br>

I'm watching where I step<br>
So I don't fall between the cracks<br>
An anti-pattern in disbelief<br><br>

I can't convince myself to be better than I am<br>
I am the watcher<br>
This is a severance<br>
We are waiting for the signs<br><br>

It'll take more than fortune and shooting stars<br>
To keep me from falling<br>
I unwrap myself<br>
I dissolve<br><br>

Into one-thousand pieces<br><br>

I am a shadow<br>
Slipping into the abyss<br>
A part of me. Never leave.

Underwater<br>
There is no chance of breathing inside this vessel<br>
Blue lipped and anemic<br>
We are constantly questioning our safety<br><br>

So much pressure. We struggle<br>
I just want to give in<br>
Please help me<br>
To keep the waters from crashing over me<br>
This ship is sinking. My heart is palpitating<br>
Your God won't save you<br><br>

We bend and twist. From distant ends<br>
Waves crash together blind without warning<br>
A great deluge. Envelop everything<br>
And all that's lost was taken<br><br>

Oh, I cannot believe this is happening<br>
Please just give me one more chance<br><br>

Pressed within your trembling hopeful hands<br>
Intangible. You're wasting time<br>
Steel rivets snap and moan<br>
Intangible<br>
Your God won't save you<br>

Now. The welds are breaking down<br>
My hands are shaking now. The welds are breaking<br>
Oh, what a shame<br><br>

You can't hide<br>
Crush the mast- envelop all<br>
Your palms together won't keep us from sinking

Crossing foothills, constructing stories<br>
Ruptured earth guiding me home<br>
Romantic fault lines<br>
A bridge's quake in my bones<br>
A place we called home<br>
A distance we have learned<br><br>

Pull me in, and help me out (of this hemisphere)<br>
I want to swim amidst the satellites<br>
Sinking to the bottom. I exhale<br>
Close my eyes- Disengage<br>
Here. There is no there.<br><br>

With everything seeming pulse-less<br>
Give me (indication). Give me (separation)<br>
I'm drifting into oblivion<br>
And there's no place I'd rather be<br>
I'm drifting into oblivion<br><br>

Isolated in black- My thoughts spin<br>
My worlds divide<br><br>

I am lost in space<br>
Burning up in the atmosphere<br>
When I finally come crashing down<br>
Wrap my bones inside miracles<br>
A safe place- I am finally home<br><br>

We usher burdens that see us through<br>
Blinding light emanates guiding me from within<br><br>

For I am just part of who I was back then<br>
Where we were. When this all began<br>
Inside this vision I am no longer in control of my own life<br>
Sickened by surroundings. Occupied and weak<br>
Tangled and desperate I expand<br><br>

I am paper thin. Lines etched and carved from misery<br>
Somebody help me please. Because I can never leave this place<br>

I am afraid of becoming you<br>
I'll deconstruct my self<br>
For I am just a part of who I was<br>
Where we were. When this all began<br>

Something inside me. I cannot fix<br>
So we begin again<br><br>

So send me to my grave<br>

Lives tremble on and on<br><br>

But we are just a perception of a common theme<br>
We are something more<br>

You were better deserved. But we all learn<br><br>

Hands to broken mirrors. We shattered our design<br>
You were always so easy for me. To leave in ruins<br><br>

Those nine summers we burned together<br>
Were disparate and beautiful<br>
Strange our thoughts can take us<br>
And I can still feel the warmth<br>
Coursing through lungs. Escaping in my thoughts<br><br>

Our hands. To broken mirrors. We shattered<br>

I hope that this letter finds you in drift<br>
Provokes shared memories and you accept my apology<br>
I was young and constantly desolate<br>
A spinning picture of grey skies<br>
I'm holding nothing back<br>
My thoughts provoked this heart attack<br><br>

And tonight I go on display to the world<br>
But we silently know, this is between you and I<br>
I hope this letter finds you in drift<br>

Our features- abrasive<br><br>

So many things we overlook<br>
Is there something that we don't know?<br>
That over time. We're over time<br>
Wrought with dysfunction, and callous minds<br>
So take the knife within my heart<br>
Sharpen it with water and virtue<br><br>

Oh, the mystery. Of what we wished we knew<br>
Oh the misery. There's so much more that I could have<br>
That I could give<br><br>

Falling faster, gaining speed<br>
Everything around me wraps me in light, precious life<br>
Something we seem to forget, I can feel something real burning inside<br>
Something we seem to forget, I can feel it burning inside of me<br><br>

Wind exerts my lungs. The influence of my being<br><br>

Weightlessness. A beautiful affection<br>
Force its hold<br>
Against my deep breath<br><br>

Oh, the mystery. Of what we wished we knew<br>
Oh the misery. There's so much more that I could have<br>

Pixelated. Construed. I am reaching out<br>
For something, for me to hold on to<br>
But I never do. Failing- I never will<br><br>

Some things just do not exist<br>
And some days I'll be the evoked of<br>
The hope for a landing, for safety<br>
But the synapse fires, exploding<br>
And this is letting go<br><br>

Life- this is a lesson that we don't sign up for<br>
But we fatefully learn<br>
And as I grow old<br>
Time will break me apart<br>
From stem to bough, and my heart to reason<br>
I will become the dirt of which I began<br><br>

Distracted by imperfection we are covered in rust<br>
Hopeless and distant, we sway side to side<br>
From season to season, we fall apart<br>
So hold this in your hand, and don't let go<br>
These are the things that we live for<br><br>

Some things just do not exist<br>
And some days I'll be the evoked of dissonant.<br>

Prudent through our brothers' eyes<br>

Eccentric circuits my soul connects<br>
Spheric and strong<br>
I no longer break down<br>
I cannot rest<br><br>

My eyes illuminate against the glass<br>
Abstaining focal shifts to palindrome lines<br>
Mimic expression. Translucent model of progression<br>
I look out, escape is granted. Free myself<br>
Unresponsive- a mechanic I work inline<br>
Scanning faces I learn the nothingness inside<br>
A binary heart beat. A digital visionary<br><br>

Escape is granted, and in this moment, I free myself<br>
As each memory fades, in this emptiness. I free myself<br>

Move along and we play pretend<br>
Surround your life with silver and gold<br>

Deconstructed and paralyzed<br>

And all the signals<br>

Into the grey a wolf amongst ravens<br><br>

A distorted creation from nothing<br>
So monstrous, so murderous<br><br>

And separate were shedding skin<br>
Scale by scale the filth replaces it<br>
You crystalize the world around you<br>

A sickness you live in<br>

Please set me free<br><br>

I will remain amongst the filth<br>
Conceal myself in this residuum<br>
I will remain amongst the filth<br>
