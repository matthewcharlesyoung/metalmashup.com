I will be the demise of your reign.<br>
I am the dark shadow where you hide.<br>
Self-righteous fascist, you chase the sun.<br>
Glory belongs to no man.<br><br>
Crooked church, you sell the Son.<br>
Thieves deserve to have no hands.<br>
Our Prisons were built with the stones of law.<br>
Whore houses are built with the bricks of religion.<br>
Oh man of God from which was your stone.<br><br>
I've stayed quiet for far too long.<br>
Cause I've typecast myself to censor what I can say.<br>
I'm so sick of this, sick of what's going on.<br>
Now I'm putting to an end of my silence.<br>
Your god's not real.<br><br>
This is the end of my silence.<br>
The wolf provides for his own but God provides for the lion.<br>
I am the lion, you are the wolf.<br>
You can run but I will find you.<br>
I am the reaper.</p>

My mother taught me to use it.<br>
So swallow back all the vomit that you're spewing.<br>
They're all buying it, but I'm not buying it.<br><br>
You can't fool me anymore.<br>
You are the curse.<br>
Your false prophesies darken my eyes and break my back.<br>
The heaven is born and hell revives.<br>
As I walked along the flames of hell.<br><br>
It became known to me.<br>
That you are nothing but a wolf in priest's clothing.<br>
They're are buying it, but I'm not buying it.<br><br>
They cry, "Lead us, oh chosen one."<br>

I wear no crown of weakness, His is no crown of weakness.<br>
I wear no crown of weakness, hide in your own contempt.<br>
Iron sharpen iron but your judgments dulling me.<br>
I answer to no man.<br>
You're no gods or masters of this world.<br>
Maybe I'm wrong.<br><br>
Maybe I'm damned.<br>
I pray I don't wake up in hell.<br>
If I were God we'd all be dead.<br>
The devil's hands have been busy.<br>
Grace sustains but I thirst for revenge.<br>
The world would be destroyed if I were God.<br><br>
Demons are fallen angels.<br>
Remember that when you think of a saint.<br>
Fallen angels I'm coming for your wings.<br>
Fallen angels I'll cut off your wings.<br>
Lord knows I'm a cynic but won't give up, won't give in.<br>
Lord knows I'm a cynic but I won't give up without a fight.<br>
The devil's hands have been busy.<br>
Turning liars to masters, demons to gods.<br>
But we're no gods, we're no masters.<br>
We're only fallen angels in this world.

Sell you soul, sell your god.<br>
Hide from all, who are you.<br><br>
The taste of gold, tastes just like blood.<br>
You murderer.<br>
Killed all my hope.<br>
Murdered everything.<br>
Innocence lost.<br>
There's no turning back.<br><br>
I question every single word you say.<br>

I am not the man you were.<br>

Risk and regret thrive tonight.<br>

Thirty hours from home, my Nashville heart's still beating<br>

To all the workers in this town<br>
Losing their minds in this great modern hell<br>

The ghosts have their guns and they will destroy<br>
Buried under broken glass lays their promised threat<br>

In the winter of 2010, I lost my mother<br>
to the barrel of her loaded gun<br>
Two weeks later my forgotten dad lost the<br>
battle of his lifelong suicidal run<br>
<br>
He was dead to me years ago<br>
But losing her was an eternal blow<br>
I've spoke in the past of the broken<br>
But now I really know<br>
<br>
If there's one thing I've learned: we're all put here to die<br>
So why jump your turn?<br>
I'm living day by day<br>

There's strange comfort in apathy<br>
I'm living day by day<br>
There's strange comfort in apathy<br>
<br>
Lay cold and alone in the ground<br>
Will it be paradise or will you burn?<br>
This is all a gamble<br>
Until it's your turn<br>
<br>
He was dead to me years ago<br>
But losing her was an eternal blow<br>
I've spoke in the past of the broken<br>
But now I really know<br>

        <h1 id="s11" class="lyrics-test">-Hands & Feet-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Speak of regretting<br>
and all the risk we take<br>
Speak to the morning and when our eyes awake<br>
The patterns are completing, the men they say we are<br>
But as the sun is setting, I'll answer in the dark<br>
<br>
When the world sings of all its trouble<br>
And I hear all about its pain<br>
I'll listen in, for its groans are not in vain<br>
<br>
It's hard to remember how these dreams were made<br>
When all the reasons and all the rules have changed<br>
There's healing in His voice and freedom in The Name<br>
But these misunderstandings we give up all the same</p>

        <h1 id="s12" class="lyrics-test">-Living The Dream-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Five years long<br>
I've been running these open roads<br>
Five years long<br>
With no place to call home<br>
<br>
Run away<br>
From everything you've ever known<br>
Run away<br>
With no place to call home<br>
<br>
Five years long<br>
I've been running these open roads<br>
Five years long<br>
I have no place to call my home<br>
<br>
Gain a friend, then I lose a friend<br>
It doesn't matter 'cause tomorrow it will happen again<br>
I'm losing touch with everyone at home<br>
It's really hard when you're born, born to roam<br>
Oh how I hate the line, "Outta sight, outta mind"<br>
I'm on the search for the greenest grass that I will never find<br>
Oh how I hate the line, "Outta sight, outta mind"<br>
I'm on the search for the greenest grass that I will never find<br>
<br>
I've run and run<br>
I've drove and drove<br>
Three hundred thousand miles of lonely roads<br>
To see the ones I love at home<br>
Move on and on without me, I'm just a memory<br>
<br>
Is this the life I chose?<br>
Have I chosen poorly?<br>
Or has it chosen me?<br>
Will it let me go now?<br>
With action comes reaction<br>
We're all a slave to something<br>
Dreams aren't meant to be lonely<br>
Will you answer me?<br>
Is this heaven or hell?<br>
<br>
Is this "living the dream"?<br>
Or is this a living nightmare?<br>
<br>
Five years long<br>
I've been running these open roads<br>
Five years long<br>
With no place to call home

        <p class="lyrics-test-test">[feat. Chad Urich of Venia]<br>
<br>
The world is on fire<br>
And I've done nothing but watch it burn<br>
The world is on fire<br>
And soon it will take the last of us<br>
<br>
I've heard it said before that boys play games and men live the truth<br>
I've had it all wrong this whole time<br>
because I thought it was all braun and brute<br>
All these tattoos and all these miles haven't made me a man just yet<br>
I'm nothing more than a frightened kid demanding undeserved respect<br>
<br>
The world is on fire<br>
The world is on fire<br>
<br>
I've been thinking a lot these days:<br>
What if hell's not all fire and devils?<br>
All the stuff they taught us as children<br>
just to keep us scared and wondering at night<br>
What if we make our own hell every time we cause pain?<br>
Every time we cause suffering there's hell on earth to pay<br>
<br>
We are all murderers here<br>
This is the life we chose, the life we lead<br>
There's only one guarantee here<br>
None of us deserves to be set free<br>
<br>
We are all murderers here<br>
This is the life we chose, the life we lead<br>
There's only one guarantee here<br>
None of us deserves to be set free<br>
<br>
We are all murderers here<br>
This is the life we chose, the life we lead<br>
There's only one guarantee here<br>
None of us deserves to be set free<br>
<br>
We are all murderers here<br>
This is the life we chose, the life we lead<br>
There's only one guarantee here</p>

        <h1 id="s14" class="lyrics-test">-The Setting Sun-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">I've seen my share<br>
of heartache but I'm not the only one<br>
My hopes and dreams are setting<br>
They're setting with the sun</p>
