Our blessings given as the children moan<br>
A man is burdened with a life full of evil<br>
Hungry eyes<br>
They will not live to see another day<br>
<br>
All in the feeling of a soul within<br>
Set it free in bloody ecstasy<br>
Lie in the circle of a few who stain<br>
(our bodies with their own blood)</p>

          <p class="lyrics-test-test">Sometimes there's a crack in<br>
the world that I can peer through,<br>
to see it for what it really is.<br>
There’s an ugly face staring back demons are everywhere,<br>
They draw the hatred from inside of me.<br>
There were times at the top of the world that I wish I could throw,<br>
Everyone and everything.<br>
Watch the mountains snap the necks of the hypocrites,<br>
I'm bathing in the thought of it.<br>
<br>
the severed dreams of all the weak - quenching thirst inside of me,<br>
And the scream it holds the key - unlocking this for all to see<br>
<br>
Fly past the trees, ascend to holy air and breathe<br>
Far from the leaves, transcend these earthly boundaries<br>
Fly past the trees, ascend to holy air and breathe<br>
Far from the leaves, transcend these fucking boundaries<br>
<br>
Isn't this desire that you're looking for?<br>
Or is insanity just knocking on your door?<br>
give me just a piece and surely you will find -<br>
Everything is better on the other side.<br>
can you look within to find what is in store?<br>
This life is but a scream that has become your whore<br>
It's tearing a hole inside, you're buried alive<br>
<br>
Sometimes there's a hole in the Earth that I can step through,<br>
To get away from the twisting of tongues.<br>
It looks a lot like a grave when I'm staring up,<br>
Feel the soil creeping over me.<br>
There were times at the top of the world that I wish I could throw,<br>
Everyone and everything.<br>
Watch the mountains snap the necks of the hypocrites,<br>
I'm bathing in the thought of it.</p>

yeah that is all I am<br>
A prison deep under fortress grounds where they spill the blood of man<br>

For now inside these walls I stay.<br>
<br>
Sitting far away I watch the blackness grow<br>
(Nevermind what is underneath the stone)<br>
(It's a life that we're living all alone)<br>
Step out in the rain and feel the deep sorrow<br>
(Light is calling from the narrow road)<br>
<br>
Sometimes kindness speaks in tongues with one of them<br>
I can see love in her eyes<br>
And if I fall death will never stain one of his hands<br>
I find safety in these lies.<br>
A second chance at life is all I've dreamed of<br>
For now inside these walls I stay<br>

The chains are part of me<br>
Stale air is all I breathe down here<br>
I need to find a way<br>
I've gotta find my way far from me<br>
Another chance at life is fading slowly<br>
Upon the cross I bleed<br>
<br>
Sitting far away I watch the blackness grow<br>
(Nevermind what is underneath the stone)<br>
(This life we live alone)<br>
Step out in the rain and feel the deep sorrow<br>
(Light is calling from the narrow road)<br>

Sitting far away I watch the blackness grow<br>
Nevermind what is underneath the stone, we live alone<br>
Step out in the rain to feel the deep sorrow<br>
Light is calling from the narrow road</p>

Suffocation and the fear of living setting in, so let go.<br>
Let go before he let's go.<br>
Patience is wearing thin and leaving him, so let go.<br>
<br>
Let go before he lets go of of this life.<br>
<br>
I wonder what goes on?<br>
<br>
Before he lets go he says,<br>
<br>
Send an angel, they're growing from the hell beyond.<br>
This weight is far too much to hold.<br>
And this body doesn't feel like home.<br>
Send and angel, I feel I'm dying all alone.<br>
So lift me up or let me go.<br>
<br>
'Cause this body doesn't feel like home.<br>
No<br>
This body doesn't feel like home.<br>
No<br>
<br>
Love feels far away.<br>
The lack of motivation keeps the soul from bettering.<br>
It's no life.<br>
Now reach the next level with a bottle and a blade.<br>
Retreating it is no way.<br>
<br>
Suffocation and the fear of living setting in, so let go.<br>
Let go before he lets go.<br>
Patience is wearing thin and leaving him, so let go.<br>
<br>
Let go before he lets go of this life.<br>
<br>
I wonder what goes on behind those bloodshot eyes?<br>
<br>
I wonder what goes on?<br>
<br>
Before he let's go he says,<br>
<br>
Send an angel, they're growing from the hell beyond.<br>
This weight is far too much to hold.<br>
And this body doesn't feel like home.<br>
Send and angel, I feel I'm dying all alone.<br>
So lift me up or let me go.<br>
<br>
'Cause this body doesn't feel like home.<br>
<br>
Sleep now and carry on into the black of the night.<br>
Sleep now and you'll be on your way.<br>
There's another one moving on from the flatline.<br>
Flatline.<br>
<br>
Sleep into the fray.<br>
Sleep between the night and day.<br>
<br>
Sleep now and carry on into the black of the night.<br>
Head greaves with everything but does it make it right?<br>
There's another one moving on from the flatline.<br>
Flatline.<br>
<br>
Sleep now and carry on, it doesn't matter.<br>
Head greaves with everything but does it make it right?<br>
There's another one moving on from the flatline.<br>
Flatline.</p>

            <p class="lyrics-test-test">Reputations made<br>
I failed to save<br>
The cold I seek is all I'll feel<br>
Today I'm selling mine after all<br>
Watch it all fade away to gray<br>
I sold it to rule the world<br>
If only I could rescue you<br>
Cleaning up the mess we've made<br>
It's not the same without your love<br>
<br>
Do you care at all?<br>
I don't see a difference<br>
Is this love at all?<br>
<br>
We stayed so close in this life at one time<br>
Now I watch as you fade away<br>
Behind the wall of hate inside your mind<br>
Will we meet again?<br>
I'll be waiting beyond the edge<br>
Forever frozen<br>
Now the time stops<br>
Revelation<br>
<br>
I've found that it's all gone<br>
The absence within us grows<br>
Illuminate the way we choose to flow<br>
<br>
Do you care at all?<br>
I don't see a difference<br>
Is this love at all?<br>
<br>
I hold one last feeling of hope<br>
Our paths will meet again<br>
Beyond the edge<br>
Forever frozen<br>
Time stops now</p>

            <h1 id="ff9" class="lyrics-test">-Catch Fire-</h1>
            <p class="lyrics-test-test">Lock eyes like we're<br>
staring down the barrel of a shotgun<br>
Appear so quickly<br>
Leave as swiftly as you came<br>
Sometimes I wish I had the measure of a wise man<br>
But I set the mood, plant the tomb and bury all the bones within<br>
It sure is something when we all catch fire<br>
Bodies burning like the sunrise<br>
<br>
Stay with me<br>
I'll show you paradise<br>
It feels so right<br>
Give me that peace of mind<br>
I'll give you everything just<br>
Know it feels so good that I could die<br>
And be alright<br>
<br>
Alive<br>
We breathe when everything is as it seems<br>
But is there something much more?<br>
Underneath the sheets, beneath the skin<br>
There's a beauty waiting to be adored<br>
We're cradled in the thick of it but too ignorant to give a shit<br>
We set the mood, we plant the tomb and bury all the bones within<br>
Don't keep me hanging from the mouth<br>
It sure is something when we all catch fire<br>
Bodies burning like the sunrise<br>
<br>
Stay with me<br>
I'll show you paradise<br>
It feels so right<br>
Give me that peace of mind<br>
I'll give you everything just<br>
Know it feels so good that I could die<br>
And join the stars<br>
Give me that peace of mind<br>
I'll give you everything just<br>
Stay with me<br>
I'll show you paradise<br>
It feels so right<br>
<br>
We exist in this moment only to fly<br>
Just stay with me<br>
Twisting love as we hold it on the inside<br>
Just stay with me<br>
<br>
It sure is something when we all catch fire<br>
Bodies burning like the sunrise<br>
<br>
Stay with me<br>
I'll show you paradise<br>
It feels so right<br>
Give me that peace of mind<br>
I'll give you everything just<br>
Know it feels so good that I could die<br>
And join the stars<br>
Give me that peace of mind<br>
I'll give you everything just<br>
Stay with me<br>
I'll show you paradise<br>
It feels so right</p>

            <h1 id="ff10" class="lyrics-test">-Prayer Position-</h1>
            <p class="lyrics-test-test">Another day pulls me down to my knees and<br>
Holds the gun to my fucking head<br>
Can't feel a thing<br>
Prayer position holding my life above the muck<br>
Oh god, I'm speaking in swirling bowls<br>
Now the walls are laughing in silence<br>
I'm spiraling down to the floor<br>
Can't feel a thing<br>
When will it end?<br>
When is it over?<br>
When can I leave?<br>
The bar is held down on my throat<br>
Kicking and screaming, I live this life down in a hole<br>
<br>
Take away misery tomorrow<br>
Shine a light to end this dimming glow<br>
Take away misery tomorrow<br>
Shine a light to end this dimming glow<br>
<br>
The day is gone<br>
Now turns the night<br>
Our bodies glow ever so bright<br>
The crash is done<br>
We reach new heights<br>
Our bodies glow ever so bright<br>
Venture through these eyes and lose all time<br>
<br>
Scratch the itch and murder the body for pleasure<br>
Sparking it up<br>
Breathing the fire we crave<br>
Guzzle it down<br>
Feeling the sparkle together<br>
Ante it up and blow me away from the high<br>
Let's go<br>
What are we doing and where have the morals all gone?<br>
Now is the time<br>
This is the feeling we treasure<br>
You won't remember but goddammit it's fine<br>
The bar is held down on my throat<br>
Kicking and screaming, I live this life down in a hole<br>
<br>
Take away misery tomorrow<br>
Shine a light to end this dimming glow<br>
Take away misery tomorrow<br>
Shine a light to end this dimming glow<br>
<br>
Stomp my head, throw me down in a hole<br>
Stomp on my heart<br>
Let's go

            <h1 id="ff11" class="lyrics-test">-Lune-</h1>
            <p class="lyrics-test-test">Snow coming down now<br>
Like December, burning up in the summer rays<br>
But I'm not stumbling, like a pretender<br>
Medicine flowing through my veins<br>
Heavy eyes, but the tongue won't stutter<br>
Mouths are moving and this heart is still fluttering<br>
I'm on my own<br>
<br>
You found me in the cold<br>
Now I am wrapped within the warmth of your touch<br>
There's never a moment that I let slip by in your eyes<br>
Are we growing old and am I melting in the rays of this love?<br>
Never ever gonna let you go<br>
Don't let go<br>
<br>
Slow it down now<br>
I cannot remember why I let them chew on my brain<br>
They've come and left this town in smoldering embers<br>
But my gift, I'll die in your rain<br>
Heavy eyes, but the tongue won't stutter<br>
Mouths are moving and this heart is still fluttering<br>
I'm on my own<br>
<br>
You found me in the cold<br>
Now I am wrapped within the warmth of your touch<br>
There's never a moment that I let slip by in your eyes<br>
Are we growing old and am I melting in the rays of this love<br>
Never ever gonna let you go<br>
Don't let go<br>
<br>
Do you feel the love?<br>
Yes I feel the love<br>
Taste it, hold it, feel it, never let it go<br>
Do you feel the love?<br>
Yes I feel the love<br>
Do you feel the love?<br>
Yes I feel the love<br>
Taste it, hold it, feel it, never let it go<br>
Do you feel the love?<br>
Yes I feel the love<br>
Don't let go</p>
