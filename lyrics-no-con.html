Before the sky turns black,<br>

If it bleeds, we can kill it.<br>

Destroy what can never fade.<br>
Senses itch as the horizon burns a point in time.<br>

All it takes is one gun.<br>

Trapped in the clutches of my memory, I need to know what it is.<br>
Teeth grinding, Heads blinding.<br>
When a clenched smile is greeted with a fist.<br>

The heavy chains of your past,<br>

Dwelling on the past will get you nowhere.<br>
Move forward; don't be held back by your doubts.<br>

          <p class="lyrics-test-test">Look at where we are,<br>
still trapped in a world of conflict and greed.<br>
Nothing's changed at all, still we're chained.<br>
Who will be the ones to set us free?<br>

Who will be the one, the ones to set us free?<br>

          <p class="lyrics-test-test">We're not the first to have seen these lies,<br>
Misinformation forced into our minds.<br>
We're not the first to have seen these lies,<br>
Our generation lost in a cycle of endless greed.<br>
Lost and blind, we're on our knees.<br>
The time has come to reawaken.<br>
Are you happy with this? Do you feel alive?<br>
Are you happy with this? Do you even see with your own eyes?<br>
Stand in line, keep your head down.<br>
Play the game, try to win the race.<br>
<br>
Our time has come, we've lost our touch to the world.<br>
It's slipping away. Reconnect with the knowledge almost lost.<br>
<br>
It's as if we were born to reignite the flame.<br>
<br>
So let the wind carry this fire and burn down,<br>
This false economy of a blood stained currency.<br>
Burn it down,<br>
We'll rise from embers left behind,<br>
Burn it down,<br>
Importance lies within the ground,<br>
Burn it down,<br>
One life is born another dies,<br>
Burn it down,<br>
And reawaken.<br>
Our time has come,<br>
We've lost our touch,<br>
To the world,<br>
Reconnect to the knowledge almost lost.<br>
Our time has come,<br>
We've lost our touch,<br>
It's slipping away<br>
Reconnect with the knowledge almost lost.<br>
Our time has come.<br>
<br>
Feeling the presence of a change, I can't describe.<br>
Feeling the presence of a change.<br>
I see it with my eyes.</p>

          <p class="lyrics-test-test">The tyrant's stronghold,<br>
Ever present and strangling,<br>
With a blatant disregard for, human rights.<br>
Dictating how to live,<br>
No chance to love and live on your own,<br>
Is this a way to live?<br>
Closed off minds,<br>
Trapped under a bigoted reign,<br>
Forced to hide,<br>
Their true being inside.<br>
<br>
Is this a way to live?<br>
You're judging everyone, freedom is a birth right.<br>
This change has got to come.<br>
Do you turn a blind eye?<br>
Ignore what's right in front of you,<br>
Indifference will not be tolerated,<br>
Corrupt police follow his every word.<br>
(His every word)<br>
<br>
Is this a way to live?<br>
Is this a way to live?<br>
Don't let history repeat itself.<br>
We can't let this,<br>
Blatant disregard for human rights,<br>
Take the world stage,<br>
Can we open our eyes?<br>
Revitalise the way we think,<br>
In this world wide struggle for equality.<br>
<br>
We must fight for this change of mind.<br>
<br>
Who has the right to judge us? Any of us?<br>
Who can judge any of us, in this life?<br>
There's something about this life.</p>

<br>
Let the colours flourish in your mind,<br>
I won't let you fall this time.<br>
All my life I've watched you slip away,<br>
Led in the wrong direction.<br>
Over and over I've watched you break down,<br>
Ruining everything you've built.<br>
Beneath the polluted sky,<br>
Your colours fade to grey.<br>
Fade to grey.<br>
<br>
Resistance, we'll take control and stop this decay,<br>
Resistance, we'll take control and stop this decay.<br>
I won't let you fade to grey.<br>
Let the colours flourish in your mind,<br>
Resistance is the saviour of our kind.<br>
Feel the warmth from ever burning light,<br>
Clear the haze and reset.<br>
<br>
Realise the strength you have inside,<br>
And see the colours with your real eyes,<br>
This is how you were meant to see.<br>
Together we will a make stand.<br>
All my life I've watched you slip away,<br>
Now's the time to change direction.<br>
Resistance is all we need,<br>
A flood of colour to clear the grey.<br>
Resistance is all we need,<br>
A flood of colour to clear the grey.<br>

Forever's just a breath away.<br>
So choose your path,<br>
Now's your time to live,<br>
A time to live.<br>
I carry these scars with pride,<br>
Learning from my mistakes.<br>
There's nothing left to hide,<br>
Forever is just a breath away.<br>
Embrace this time,<br>
Hold it forever,<br>
The only promise that can't be kept.<br>
It can't be kept.<br>
Don't be trapped under the weight of your past.<br>
Free yourself from the pressure deep within.<br>
<br>
The ocean of memories is a vast and all encompassing.<br>
Don't drown in fear that surrounds you.<br>
We'll rise above the tide,<br>
Breathe in the air<br>
And live the life that we want to lead.<br>
Clear of mind, clear with time.<br>
You alone can shape the course of your own reality.<br>
You alone can change the course of your reality.<br>
Forever is just a breath away.

          <p class="lyrics-test-test">Have you ever wondered,<br>
why you live the life you lead?<br>
We're running round in circles,<br>
trying to feed the system's needs.<br>
We're all lost in a system,<br>
only built to crush your dreams.<br>
So do we concede or do we endeavour to break the chain.<br>
Can we realise our true potential, or do we live in fear.<br>
This is a truth we all have to face.<br>
<br>
This is the truth we'll have to face,<br>
Empower yourself.<br>
Realise your true potential.<br>
Empower yourself.<br>
<br>
So what is the real value,<br>
of a life spent earning?<br>
Just staring at a screen.<br>
Caught in a web of society,<br>
Pursuing the needs of a few.<br>
Endlessly wasting our lives,<br>
Break down the walls of apathy and be free.<br>
Break down these walls,<br>
Empower yourself,<br>
Realise your true potential,<br>
Empower yourself.<br>
<br>
Stop wasting the only time you have behind a desk,<br>
Scraping by day to day just get your next paycheque,<br>
Is this the life you really wanted to lead?<br>
Are you human?<br>
Or just a citizen?<br>
So I've made my choice to,<br>
Remove myself,<br>
I'll never be a number.<br>
This life's worth more than a currency.<br>
<br>
Caught in the web of society,<br>
Pursuing the needs of a few.<br>
Endlessly wasting our lives,<br>
Break down the walls of apathy and be free.<br>
Break down these walls,<br>
Empower yourself,<br>
And realise your true potential,<br>
Empower yourself.</p>

          <h1 id="t8" class="lyrics-test">-Speechless-</h1>
          <p class="lyrics-test-test">Out on the edge, you stand alone.<br>
A shallow, worthless hole,<br>
nowhere to turn, you're lost within yourself.<br>
The reflection in front of you cuts, deeper,<br>
it cuts you to the bone.<br>
How can you do this to yourself?<br>
You're just an empty shell.<br>
You leave me speechless.<br>
<br>
With no remorse, you just carry on.<br>
A self-destructive path tears you away, from reality.<br>
Disregarding, who you are.<br>
<br>
Lost, drifting, further away.<br>
Out on the edge, you stand alone.<br>
An empty shell of who you used to be.<br>
Are you gonna give up here and now,<br>
or face this misery? Misery.<br>
You're your inner conflict, it breeds like a disease.<br>
How can you do this to yourself,<br>
you're just an empty shell,<br>
you leave me speechless.<br>
With no remorse, you just carry on,<br>
masking the truth with fear again.<br>
Disregarding, who you are. Who you are.<br>
<br>
Do you even know yourself?<br>
Hollow existence, fragments fall away.<br>
How can you do this to yourself?<br>
A truth to know should be plain to see.<br>
The time has come for you to dream free.<br>
The fragments fall away, they fade away.<br>
<br>
Out on the edge, you stand alone.<br>
Conscious now of who you used to be.<br>
The mirror shattered your shallow mask,<br>
no longer consumed by vanity.<br>
<br>
Open your eyes to see the light?<br>
Feel it move across your face.<br>
It shines from within.<br>
You're speechless.</p>

          <p class="lyrics-test-test">How did we make it this far?<br>
How did we end up in this place?<br>
Do we know we are? Disconnected and awake.<br>
Searching for the key, for our reality.<br>
Oh what is it to be alive?<br>
Endless miles, a burning hunger drives us on.<br>
Every step is a mirage, this is not how you said it would be.<br>
<br>
Follow this path with me.<br>
This is not how you said it would be.<br>
Trust in the change you seek.<br>
This is not how you said it would be.<br>
Disconnect from what you fear,<br>
to wonder what it is to be alive?<br>
Senses awaken, its right there in from of me.<br>
Can you feel this? This journey has become me. It's within us all.<br>
<br>
How did we make it this far?<br>
When did we cross that line?<br>
Leaving everything behind.<br>
We've come this far. Now I know my path.<br>
An awakening, now my vision is clear.<br>
We've come too far to turn back now.<br>
Embrace this change, let go of doubt<br>
We've come too far to turn back now.<br><br>
So embrace the change and let go of doubt,<br>
to begin again.<br>
Disconnect from what you used to be and begin again.

Reconcile, who we are.<br>
Read the signs.<br>
Whole? Are you whole?<br>
Still Searching for the piece to change,<br>
Everything about this.<br>
<br>
Show me a sign, of who we are.<br>
The memories fade and the piece you've thrown away,<br>
Won't be coming back.<br>
You can't win back the piece you throw away.<br>
The piece that you break, you can never hold on to.<br>
Bury me in the silence,<br>
I am the liar and the honest man.<br>
No matter the difference,<br>
the memories still fade away. (It still fades away)<br>
All I see is beauty in decay.<br>
I see the beauty in decay.<br>
Nothing stays the same,<br>
We grow apart in different ways.<br>
And I'm watching it burn.<br>
So now I see, who we are.<br>
The memories fade and the piece you throw away won't be coming back.<br>
It won't be coming back.<br>
<br>
Soft spoken, dismantlement,<br>
I'm asking how does this end.<br>
How does this end,<br>
Show me a sign of who we are.</p>

While I sleep, I dream of being,<br>
Carried away. Far away,<br>
By the wings made of the dew that awakens.<br>
Over earth, over ocean. Take me away.<br>
Over earth, over ocean. Carry me far.<br>
<br>
And the midnight breeze reminds me,<br>
I'm still alive,<br>
As I bathe in the light.<br>
Under the moon,<br>
My fears disappear.<br>
<br>
Over earth, over ocean. Carry me,<br>
far away. Over earth, over ocean. Carry me far.<br>
In the downpour,<br>
I let the water cleanse the past,<br>
In the downpour,<br>
I dissolve.<br>
<br>
Carry me far away from here.<br>
I hope one day we find ourselves.<br>
Out of the caverns of rain,<br>
A light breaks through.<br>
Like a ghost from a tomb, I arise.<br>
We pass over distant shores, far away.<br>
Far away, we find ourselves<br>
Up among the clouds, I know,<br>
That this is it.<br>
<br>
This is it.</p>
