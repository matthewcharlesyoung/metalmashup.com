For once my eyes are open to you, and everything you've said.<br>
For once your web of lies is in the open.<br>
I gave you everything I had, until I had nothing left.<br>
Still you act as if I'm just a burden.<br>
I've finally let go. Let go, let go.<br><br>

Stay silent at least for now, and let me move on.<br>
'Cause I'm so done playing these games with my heart<br>
I've been around the world and back for you, and now its time to choose.<br><br>

I've been swallowed by this wreck that you call your life.<br>
I'm damaged from the inside. I've been broken.<br>
Don't threaten me with what you think I feel.<br>
If you could read my mind you'd be in tears.<br><br>

I'm sick of your excuses you hold above me.<br>
I've finally come to terms with what I am.<br>
I'm nothing in your eyes, and this will not change.<br>
I'm living in a dream.<br><br>

Stay silent at least for now, and let me move on.<br>
'Cause I'm so done playing these games with my heart<br>
I've been around the world and back for you, and now its time to choose.<br><br>

And I'll close my eyes, and dream of a better time<br>
when I'll be finally past this and I'll be happy on my own.<br>
I've done all I can, and I've still been cast aside.<br>
All I ever wanted to be was be the one who would wipe tears from your eyes.<br>
But I guess I'll play second best, to a world that will never care about you.<br>
You'll never understand you're just another pretty face<br>
You'll tell me that you care, and then run straight back to him.<br>
I can hear your voice of treason from a mile away.<br><br>

You never did know how to whisper.<br><br>

You're such a liar. Tell me the truth.<br>
You're such a liar. Tell me the truth.<br>
You fucking liar. Tell me the truth.<br>
Do the world a favor, stop cutting your arms, and slit your throat.

Wo-oh [2x]<br><br>
You Want It, You've got It<br>
You've always been such a waste of tim<br>
You Want It, You've got It<br>
A friend of your's is no friend of mine<br>
You Want It, You've got It<br>
When will you act your age<br>
You Want It, You've got It<br>
You're the reason things have to change<br>
Wo-oh [2x]<br>
You're the reason things have to change<br>
Wo-oh [2x]<br><br>
When you fall I'll be the only one who looks away<br>
When you can I'll be the first to tell you I can't stay<br>
It's all over, I've found a better way<br>
To help keep you from me, I'm better off this way<br>
Wo-oh [2x]<br>
I'm better off this way<br>
Wo-oh [2x]<br>
I'm better off this way

Remember when I tried?<br>
I never strayed too far from you<br>
Forever by your side<br>
No matter what I was going through<br>
But now I never know the things to say to you<br>
That help me prove that I'm still on your side<br>
I never show just what you do to me<br><br>

My world cannot ever bring me down<br>
Gave everything I had to turn it back around<br>
Cause our time's worth something bigger than both you and me<br>
I can't live my life always backing down<br>
I gotta do this right, then they can't make a sound<br>
Cause I'm here for nothing, least I can say<br>
I stand for something<br><br>
You and me, we stand for something<br>

I leave no time to myself the only way I can fight it<br>
When I'm alone it's like I'm staring into a mirror<br>
Don't know the person inside it and that's never been any clearer<br>
I miss our family and I miss all my friends<br>
If you had it to do over your do it over again<br>
Cause I would, it means something more to me<br>
There's a whole in my heart where you use to be<br><br>

I still wish you the best of luck baby<br>
And don't go thinking this was a waste of time<br>
I couldn't forget you if I tried<br>
You killed what was left of the good in me<br>
I'm tired so let me be broken<br>
Look down at the mess that's in front of me<br>
No other words may be spoken<br>
And I've got nobody else to blame though I tried<br>
Kept all of my past mistakes down inside<br>
I'll live with regret for my whole life<br><br>

I confess, that I brought this all on my self<br>
Condemned to suffer alone, like there's nobody else<br>
When your gone, it's like a whole part of me's missing<br>
So I'll keep living the lie and just hope that your listening<br><br>

I tried to make us a life here<br>
But our foundation was built on sand<br>
Now stop and run until the damage was done<br>
And I've never had the upper hand<br><br>

I still wish you the best of luck baby<br>
And don't go thinking this was a waste of time<br>
I couldn't forget you if I tried<br>

All the things you love are all the things I hate<br>
How did we get here in the first place?<br><br>

All but your cold blood inside your mind (All my trust)<br>
Is always burning inside of me (All the way)<br>
I can't make any more progress I know I'll faint<br>
The only thing that can heal this this time is space<br><br>

You killed what was left of the good in me<br>
I'm tired so let me be broken<br>
Look down at the mess that's in front of me<br>
No other words may be spoken<br>
And I've got nobody else to blame though I tried<br>
Kept all of my past mistakes down inside<br>

You will see, oh believe me<br>
I need to be right where you are<br>
And know that I'm leaving, leaving<br>
And you won't hear for a year from now<br>

Something went wrong along the way, you come around and there's nothing left to say<br>

Never let anything keep a hold of me<br>
Could always tell when somethings missing<br>

I still gave it everything, I guess I'll never catch my break<br><br>

Remember way back when? They said this life was a dream.<br>
Well it still is, I never wanna wake.<br>
Standing in my backyard at our old practice space<br>
Hard to hold back the tears from streaming down my face.<br><br>

That was then, this is now.<br>
You can't run before you go learn how, and you won't.<br>

This is our corner of the world,<br>
Where we can come to be ignored.<br>
This is our point where we return.<br>
This is where I came from.<br>
This is where I came from.<br><br>

Remember way back when? This place seemed bigger to me.<br>
Learned how to play guitar, and made my mom watch me.<br>
We always knew back then, just where I'd be right now.<br>
We never questioned it, was more like when and how.<br><br>

That was then, this is now.<br>
You can't run before you go learn how, and you won't.<br><br>

This is our corner of the world,<br>
Where we can come to be ignored.<br>
This is our point where we return.<br>
This is where I came from.<br>
This is what made us who we became.<br>
Where they know me, not just my name.<br>
There's not another place the same,<br>
This is where I came from.<br>
This is where I came from.<br><br>

Yeah!<br><br>

You had another thing coming if you were sleeping on us.<br>
Same old voices in my ear saying enough is enough.<br>
Well, I'm saying me and all my friends don't need you around.<br>

Oh oh oh, this is where I came from, I'm right back at it again.<br>

Started out in the spring of 2003.<br>
Never went to school, nobody talked to me.<br>
Except to tell me all the things I couldn't do.<br>
Don't want to hear about it.<br>
Cramming our bags into the back of all our cars.<br>
We all but knew but seemed to never know the part.<br>
I played a show that night till it made me sick.<br><br>

So here I am.<br>
I'm right back at it again.<br>
Just like I've always said,<br>
You're just too cool for school.<br>
I ain't here to make no friends.<br>
And I said hey! (HEY)!<br>
I'm right back at it again.<br>
Just like I have always said,<br>
You're too cool for school.<br>
I ain't here to make no friends.<br><br>

That tour we'd go to the backup plan.<br>
And everyone we knew that we couldn't stand.<br>
Said if you can't make it here you won't make it there.<br>
Don't want to hear about it.<br>
Spent most of our nights sleeping on hardwood floors.<br>
Needed help getting help getting through to any open doors.<br>
Played a show that night, till it all made sense.<br><br>

So here I am.<br>
I'm right back at it again.<br>
Just like I've always said,<br>
You're too cool for school.<br>
I ain't here to make no friends.<br>
And I said hey (HEY)!<br>

Don't wanna hear about it,<br>
Don't wanna hear about it! (HEY)!<br><br>

Just like I've always said,<br>
You're just too cool for school.<br>
I ain't here to make no friends.<br>
And I said hey!<br>
I'm right back at it again.<br>
Just like you'll always say,<br>

And the fears sets in, in an instant.<br>
Too much of myself gets exposed.<br>
This is where I go at my weakest,<br>
When I don't have to be scared to tell the truth.<br>

Tend to do my best when everything goes wrong.<br>
That's why sad songs make me happy, cause I don't have to feel alone.<br><br>

You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me.<br>

Go get carried away.<br><br>

It's never what you've done, it's what you've done lately.<br>
Who cares what you're saying, if no ones listening.<br>
You don't have to like me, but you're gonna respect me.<br>
I that came from nothing, leave hope in my wake.<br><br>

I got no regrets, but have my days with doubt.<br>
To those left in sadness I'll be the one to lead you out.<br><br>

You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me.<br>
Take it away from me.<br>

You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me.<br>
Go get carried away.<br><br>

I reserve my right to feel uncomfortable reserve my right to be afraid.<br>
I make mistakes and I am humbled every step of the way.<br>
I want to be a better person. I wanna know the master plan.<br>
Cast your stones, cast your judgement, you don't make me who I am.<br>

God help those who help themselves, and forget about everyone else.<br>
You lost your nerve, you missed the point.<br>
God help those with open hands, may they never feel burden again.<br>

I'll close the distance.

But we all need to know when enough is enough.<br><br>

So when the world outside cant see what's wrong and right.<br>
People can't understand the reasons that we fight.<br>
Somethings gotta give.<br><br>

Violence, give me violence,<br>
cause they say we're the worthless ones.<br>
Substance, give me substance.<br>
Heavy lies the crown as I cut you down.<br>
[x2]<br><br>

You only get one chance and that's one too much.<br>
What's the world gonna say when I call your bluff, punk?<br><br>

Bow your head.<br><br>

Violence, give me violence,<br>
cause they say we're the worthless ones.<br>
Substance, give me substance.<br>
Heavy lies the crown as I cut you down.<br>

I'll be the one, I'll be your spark,<br>
I'll be your light led through the darkness<br><br>

I get<br>
I get<br>
I get so misunderstood<br><br>

Something changed the way we interact<br>
Now we can't get it back<br>
Another relic of the past<br>
Makes you think, did I ever know you at all?<br>
Follow until I fall<br>
Vultures circling in the sun<br><br>


Why can't we say the things, the things we wish we would<br>
Why can't we laugh the way, the way we know we should<br>
Fall under the weight of all the pressure that's misplaced<br>
Flaws that I embrace<br><br>

Everybody sees your head’s hung low<br>
They don't ask, they don't wanna know us<br>
I'll be the one, I'll be your spark,<br>
I'll be your light led through the darkness<br><br>

I get<br>
I get<br>
I get so misunderstood<br><br>

You can't just avoid the issue<br>
You should learned from the things we've been through<br>
You don't know what you have until it’s lost<br>
Till the hammer drops<br>

Brace, fall [8x]<br>

Fall under the weight of all the pressure that's misplaced<br>
Flaws that I embrace<br><br>

Everybody sees your head’s hung low<br>
They don't ask, they don't wanna know us<br>
I'll be the one, I'll be your spark,<br>
I'll be your light led through the darkness<br>

I get<br>
I get<br>
I get so misunderstood</p>

Am I worth a reassemble?<br>
I toss, turn beneath the waves.<br>
A silent victim of the depths.<br><br>
Cast aside I'm scrambling to catch my…<br>
I can't find my way out, as I'm descending.<br>
My path remains unclear as the water overtakes me.<br>
Drowning in my despair.<br>

No where's safe alone in the tide.<br>
I'm alone and it sinks in.<br>
The current's pulling me under.<br>
Drowning in my despair.<br><br>

The surf's against us.<br>
Are we able?<br>
Forgive our faults when they're shameful.<br>
Let's be honest with ourselves.<br><br>
Worn and broken.<br>
Reassembled.<br>
Forgive our thoughts when they're shameful.<br>
Let's be honest with ourselves.<br>
Let's be honest with ourselves.

We all knew better, name it, we've been there.<br><br>
When I had a place that I could call my own.<br>
We spent most days counting the ways.<br>

Go find something that makes you feel complete.<br>

      <p class="lyrics-test-test"> just a wave, an emotion, and right then I knew that everything had changed.<br>
A whole side of you that went missing's gone and all I'd thought of you is wrong gotta step away, for perspective.<br>
Need to take a chance to clear my head.<br>
Don't wanna understand your position.<br>
Ought to wash me of you and run.<br>
Think I lost my nerve, like I lost in you.<br>
Held trapped by what we were.<br><br>
No, I'll never feel the same about you.<br>
Spent time today reminiscing.<br>
Think I learned a lot about who we are.<br>
Couldn't diagnose your condition.<br>
But now I see the signs you left behind.<br>
Think I lost my nerve, like I lost you.<br>
And the truth remains unheard.<br>
No, I'll never feel the same about you.<br><br>
Some roads you can't come back from, when you extract truth from the lie.<br>
No, I'll never feel the same about you.<br>

There's something missing.<br>
There's an anger in living half the world away.<br>
I hope you listen for a person.<br>
With perspective.<br><br>
That isn't always the same.<br>
No need to water it down right now, you play the victim, but it's all a charade.<br>
Times they, they are a-changin', get your things in order or get out of the way.<br>
And it goes on and and on and on.<br>
Turn off the radio till they've got something real to say.<br>
Turn off the radio to clear my mind and let me think.<br>
I need an answer, I've got the questions.<br>
Can't anyone out there just relate?<br><br>
Turn off the radio.<br>
There's a division in our culture that we live with every day.<br>
We're just people eating people.<br>
Such a sick sad world we live in today.<br>
All I know's I wanna be everything expected of me.<br>
So everyone we can agree somebody out there understands me.<br><br>
And it goes on and on and on.<br>
Turn off the radio till they've got something real to say.<br>
Turn off the radio to clear my mind and let me think. I need an answer, I've got questions.<br>
Can anyone out there just relate?<br>
Turn off the radio.<br><br>
Someone out there if you're listening, we're the victims of our indifference.<br>
Tell us more without controlling.<br>
What we think what you're showing.<br>
Turn off the radio till they've got something real to say.<br>
Turn off the radio to clear my mind and me think.<br><br>
I need an answer, I've got the questions.<br>

I feel like a runaway.<br>
Seeing the light of day for the first time.<br>
I'm drawing the line.<br>
It's hard to care when you know it all.<br>
In slow motion I watch you fall, like you're blind, thoughts poison the mind.<br>
I always bend when it comes to you.<br>
I think you'll change but ya never do, you never do.<br>
I enable you.<br><br>
Let me down, let me down like only you know how.<br>
Shut me out, shut me out, forgive and forget.<br>
Wish that I could say this to your face.<br>
Something different, something brave.<br>
Wish I would, but I never could.<br><br>
I feel you slowly pulling me in.<br>
I try to help but it's sink or swim and you're a weight.<br>
There's comfort in pain.<br><br>
Let me drown, let me down like only you know how.<br>
Shut me out, shut me out, forgive and forget.<br>
You've drained all the love I had.<br>
All I had for you.<br>
Ya you've drained all the love I had.<br>

We fell, from great heights, disgusted looks in my neighbor's eyes.<br>
You reflect me in my negative space.<br>
Please forgive me for the time you'll waste.<br>
If you let me I'll give you a taste.<br><br>
Everyone eventually lets you down.<br>
Your heart, my lungs, in unison when I bite my tongue.<br>
Escape, at long last, burn the bridge never look back.<br>
You reflect me in my negative space.<br>
Please forgive me for the time you'll waste.<br><br>
If you let me I'll give you a taste.<br>
Everyone eventually lets you down.<br>
I don't care.<br><br>
I don't care.<br>
About what you think.<br>
I won't hear.<br>
I won't hear.<br><br>
Anything you say.<br>

      <p class="lyrics-test-test">[Deluxe Edition Bonus Track]<br>

December ain't cold at all this year in Florida.<br>
But I'm still chilled to the bone.<br>
The mind plays tricks this time of the year in Florida.<br>
It's not the time to be alone.<br>
I feel the less you love the less you feel alive.<br><br>
I feel to understand it starts from the inside.<br>
And I feel the patience is a lesson learned in time.<br>
To be good with your own life's to be good with mine.<br>
Time stands still this time of year in Florida.<br>
The only time I feel at home.<br><br>
The neighborhood kids run down the road in Florida.<br>
It's got me scared I missed the boat.<br>
I feel the less you love the less you feel alive.<br>
I feel to understand it starts from the inside.<br><br>
And I feel that patience is a lesson learned in time.<br>
To be good with your won life's to bee with mine.<br>
I always knew that I would leave, but I didn't think it'd change a part of me.<br>
Can't get back to who I was back then.<br><br>
Feels wrong to shut that out.<br>
Seems wrong to pretend.<br><br>
I feel the less you love the less you feel alive.<br>
I feel to understand it starts from the inside.<br>
And I feel that patience is a lesson learned in time.<br>
To be good with your own life's to be good with mine.
