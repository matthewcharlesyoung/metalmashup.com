      <p class="lyrics-test-test">Pulverization- bones snap, break, and rend<br>
Trituration- truncheon falls again and again<br>
Castigation- dumbstruck, dazed and contused<br>
Excruciation- blackened, bludgeoned, blinded, and bruised<br>
As hammer to anvil<br>
As hammer…<br>
As hammer to anvil<br>
To anvil…<br><br>
Agonized- pummeled, crushed, pounded, and beat<br>
Tenderized- cringing, battered human meat<br>
Traumatized- painful, unbearable, ceaseless throbbing<br>
Brutalized- thrashed and subjected to quite a drubbing<br>
As hammer to anvil<br>
As hammer…<br>
As hammer to anvil<br>
To anvil…<br><br>
Forging death, upon this human anvil<br>
Prepared to smite as I raise the handle<br>
Writhe in pain, at the hammer’s blow<br>
Hammer fells, like tolling bells<br>
Ring out their dull and pounding knells<br>
The final sounds, you’ll ever know<br><br>


I smash your brittle bones to powder<br>
Screams crescendo ever louder<br>
<br>

Your shattered torso now gone to bits<br>
A puzzle of pieces that no longer fit<br>
As hammer to anvil<br>
As hammer…<br>
As hammer to anvil<br>
To anvil…</p>

Shattered gross anatomy<br>
Bodily fluids, foul and septic<br>
I sing the body decrepit<br>
Your funeral, my feast<br>
You’ll never rest in peace<br>
Tagged, sectioned, then slabbed<br>
Slurp fluids from your body-bag<br><br>
Repulsive, jaundiced flesh - The stomach-turning sight, that I love best<br>
Necrosis setting in - Discolored, rotting, mottled skin<br>
The weevils writhe and squirm - Your torso now alive with worms<br>
As organs liquefy - I whet my abhorrent appetite<br>
Your funeral, my feast<br><br>
A masterstroke of rotting meat<br>
My dinner table’s where you rest in piece<br>
Your funeral, my feast<br>
Gruesome garnish, moist carnage<br>
Raw bits of human garbage<br>
The chunks seep, they won’t keep<br>
Gnashing through, as each piece bleeds<br>
Your decay, my entrée<br><br>
I wouldn’t have it any other way<br>
Maggot millet, stuffs your gullet<br>
To please my most deranged of palettes<br>
Splenetic, ghastly taste - The stinking savor of pathological waste<br>
Trypsin and Pepsin marinate - The loathsome bowels I masticate<br>
To dine upon this foul concoction - Requires a taste for extreme unction<br>
But for those who have the stomach - We sate our hunger on tripe and vomit<br>
Your funeral, my feast<br>
A masterstroke of rotting meat<br>
My dinner table’s where you rest in piece<br>
Your funeral, my feast<br>

      <p class="lyrics-test-test">I see the world through cadaver eyes<br>
Sickened by the sight of all that I despise<br>
Rotting mass devoured by maggots and flies<br>
A ghoulish feast upon the necrotized<br>
I see the world through cadaver eyes<br>
A sucking grave from which nothing will rise<br>
Too late we’ve just begun to realize<br>
All that we touch, we cause to rot and die<br><br>
The ichor in which we’re immured<br>
Clotted, purulent, and impure<br>
Infected well past any hope of cure<br>
This is the world that I see<br>
Decaying for the feasts of parasites<br>
The human wreckage whets their appetites<br>
In the polluted carnage they delight<br>
Our flesh their fetid fantasy<br><br>
Their fetid fantasy<br>
Through cadaver eyes - the shroud torn back<br>
To view the carnage at which we hack - bleeding black<br>
Through cadaver eyes - see only death<br>
The putrid truth of what is left - rotten flesh<br>
Inhale the crematory’s noxious reek<br>
Savor the stench of a world deceased<br>
The taste of slaughter that our palettes seek<br>
To dull the buzzing in our brains<br><br>
Taste the blight fester within your flesh<br>
With every mouthful that you gasp for breath<br>
Revolted by this wretched world grotesque<br>
And every horror it contains<br>
Every horror it contains<br><br>
Through cadaver eyes - the shroud torn back<br>
To view the carnage at which we hack - bleeding black<br>
Through cadaver eyes - see only death<br>
The putrid truth of what is left - rotten flesh<br>
<br>
Through cadaver eyes - the shroud torn back<br>
To view the carnage at which we hack - bleeding black<br>
Through cadaver eyes - see only death<br>
The putrid truth of what is left - rotten flesh<br>
All the world is a cadaver’s eye<br>
We crawl like maggots from beneath its stye<br>
Engorged we consume, to be consumed in time<br>
A noisome plague in both death and life</p>

      <h1 id="f5" class="lyrics-test">-Death Knell-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">Purulent portents augur decrepit demise<br>
A tumescent terminus draws near<br>
Sloughing skin, boils erupt before your very eyes<br>
Carbuncles and lesions appear<br>
Wracked with infection - excruciated<br>
An affliction which will not abate<br>
Eczemic flesh stripped away - excoriated<br>
A fetid, disease-ridden fate<br>
Moribund, vomiting blood<br>
All over the hospital floor<br><br>
Not long for this earth, it only gets worse<br>
Physiognomy ridden with sores<br>
Rendered grotesque, thorax fills with cess<br>
Suffering until your demise<br>
Corrode from within, sepsis sets in<br>
Innards begin to liquefy<br>
Too late, face fate- Await, death’s gate<br>
Sound the death knell - Sound the death knell<br>
Overripe omens ooze out of your maw<br>
Excrescent expectorate expunged<br>
Sallowed skin, blistered and raw<br>
Hacking up bits of clot-caked gunge<br><br>
Riddled with welts - suppurated<br>
Day by day this decay sprays its filth<br>
Drain the pus into pans - intubated<br>
Discharging bloody, pyomorphic swill<br>
Feculent, purulent<br>
Rampant infection now grown out of hand<br>
Nauseated, expectorated<br>
Bits of innards floating in your bedpan<br>
Too late, face fate- Await, death’s gate<br>
Sound the death knell - Sound the death knell<br>
<br>

Disgusting yourself, you turn inside out<br>
Epidermal revulsion takes hold<br>
Prognosis is grim, there can no more doubt<br>
You’re soon to be stiff, dead and cold<br>
Vital organs spew forth - regurgitated<br>
Prolapse of bowels, sinew and crud<br>
Sanguineous breath - asphyxiated<br>
Esophagus torn, drown in your own blood<br>
Violent death, terminal breath<br>
The hospital bed now a gore-soaked grave<br>
Your execrable corpse, taken down to the morgue<br>
Fodder for pathologists depraved<br>
Too late, face fate- Await, death’s gate<br>
Sound the death knell - Sound the death knell

Disfigured features re-sected upon being torn apart<br>
My cubist rhinoplasty has left you defaced<br>
Any semblance of dignity erased and replaced<br>
The face of death staring at you is only your own<br>
Distorted and twisted to form<br>
The medium of meat, tendon, sinew and bone<br><br>
Distorted and twisted to form<br>
Eye-sockets rerouted, now to re-wire your shattered jaw<br>
Aesthetic mutilation leaves facial tissue red raw<br>
Gouged, cleft and hacked, now you’re drastically deformed<br>
Through your grisly countenance, as an objet d’art you are reborn<br>
The face of death staring at you is only your own<br>
Distorted and twisted to form<br>
The medium of meat, tendon, sinew and bone<br>
Distorted and twisted to form<br><br>
Sightless eyes - gaze vacantly at the monstrous face in the reflection<br>
Chiaroscuro realized - Obscure art incarnated through unnatural selection<br>
<br>

Disintegrating death masque<br>
eering features rearranged disgustingly askew<br>
The work of a hack<br>
our visage gleams with the moist sheen of sanguine and sinew<br>
<br>

The face of death staring at you is only your own<br>
Distorted and twisted to form<br>
The medium of meat, tendon, sinew and bone<br>

A macabre descent<br>
Through a mass of necrosis<br>
To reach beyond the end<br>
Suppurative cessation<br>
An ending in gore<br>
Pathological obsession<br>
To reach the rotten core<br>
Tangle of bowels I now unravel deep within<br>
Lost in this carnal labyrinth<br>
Tumescent hive, or just a human rubbish bin<br>
Lost in this carnal labyrinth, I rot within<br>
Serpentine intestines<br>
Their coil unwinds<br>
Mortuous vexation<br><br>
Is all there is to find<br>
Repugnant, reeking maze<br>
That seems without egress<br>
Enterotome, chisel and bonesaw the keys<br>
To open the abscess<br>
Tangle of bowels I now unravel deep within<br>
Lost in this carnal labyrinth<br>
Tumescent hive, or just a human rubbish bin<br>
Lost in this carnal labyrinth, I rot within<br><br>

Quagmire in pus<br>
Livor Mortis’ aftermath<br>
Posthumous waste<br>
Culling human chaff<br>
The grotesque grip<br>
Of death’s dissolve<br>
Ensnared in entrails<br>
The puzzle unsolved<br><br>
Tangle of bowels I now unravel deep within<br>
Lost in this carnal labyrinth<br>
Tumescent hive, or just a human rubbish bin<br>
Lost in this carnal labyrinth, I rot within

Postmortem butchery<br>
Hack - through the thorax with bonesaw and pick-axe<br>

Staining forceps, hemostat and file<br>
Rend - through cold flesh, never minding the mess<br>
Dis-organized carnal junk heap<br>

Another commodity, slaughtered, skinned, and cheaply bought<br>
The scent entices, the necrovores began to slaver<br>
Scavengers buzz and burrow in their putrescent palaver<br>
If you bleed it, they will come<br>
As sharks grown voracious at the scent of chum<br>
Necrotized - anaesthetized<br>
Necrotized - dehumanized<br><br>
Bile-baiting is child’s play, second nature of the beast<br>
To serve up a bilious buffet for our feculent, feral feast<br>
A thrill-kill marathon to hyper-stimulate the reptile brain<br>
Tune in, turn on, to a titillating thanatotic refrain<br>
If you bleed it, they will come<br>
To feast upon what’s spewed from humanity’s rectum<br>
Necrotized - desensitized<br>
Necrotized - lobotomized<br><br>
The mind of morbidity perplexed<br>
Putrefaction’s pungent, prurient hex<br>
With vivisecting vitriol we vex<br>
Our sordid, soiled, slaughterous secrets<br>
<br>
Shocking, septic, sickening scenes, all taken to extremes<br>
Sardonic grins, take the place of outraged screams<br>
When waking nightmare is de rigeur for the daily grind<br>
Waxing grotesque is the best means of killing time<br>
If you bleed it, they will come<br>
To live vicariously through the deaths and lives of scum<br>
Necrotized - commoditized<br>

A gruesome hulk of rotting meat where fluids congeal<br>
Truth - without beauty<br>
Cruelty - without beauty<br>
Funereality<br>
Global mass-grave for humanity<br>
Where the ghoulish feed on atrocities<br>
Funereality<br>
Immersed within a miasma of carnage<br>
We chew our way through a quagmire of human garbage<br>
This world belongs to the maggots, weevils and grubs<br>
Who gladly join us in the graves that we’ve so eagerly dug<br>

The voracious feed as the rapacious bleed<br>

A landscape of monuments and cemeteries<br>
Befouled air smelling thick of the crematory<br>
Our deadened world laid to rest permanently<br>

Repellant rite now sanctified, pallid parody of the putrefied<br>
In formaldehyde death now baptized - reborn<br>
The sickening sight now sanitized<br>
In celebration of the demised<br><br>
Death unrevealed - decay clumsily disguised<br>
But behind the lurid, leering eyes<br>
Decomposition will arise<br>
So let it be rotten - so let it be done<br>

So let it be rotten - so let it be done<br><br>
So let it be rotten<br>
So let it be rotten - so let it be done<br>
So let it be rotten<br>

Immured deep within the absurd, beyond the pale obscenely blurred<br>
Rigor mortis sets in undeterred - putrescent<br><br>
Embalmed in lugubrious repose, as from within you decompose<br>
Unmoved by orchid, lily, or rose - quiescent<br>
The distasteful scent lurks just beneath<br>
The truth of death lay out of reach<br>
Its cold caress - would curdle funeral wreaths<br>
But beyond the mendacious mask you’ll see<br>
Putrefaction’s perfidy<br><br>
So let it be rotten - so let it be done<br>
Within the casket, decay has claimed its throne<br>
So let it be rotten - so let it be done<br>
Death worms its way into the corpse its work begun<br>

Filthy lucre's gleam - leaves you excoriated at the seams<br>
The rented corpse you've been, now teems, a necrovore's unburied dream<br>

Clinking coppers fall upon dead ears<br>
Overdrawn and overtaxed for years<br>

Coffin nails are never still - ever more plots we've yet to fill<br>
Another deposit in the till, gravehills, rising grim and still<br>
Some say that death is dead - it's all undertaking, too much overhead<br>

A mephitic harbinger - of inexorable decay<br>

Blood bears infection - as it courses through<br>

Of myself in the mirror - cowering from the light<br>
Sickened in heart and mind - bowed beneath this blight<br>
Flesh suppurates - blood drains to white<br>

Once infected death's grip seizes through my veins<br>
Blackening sores erupt, fever boils through my brains<br>

As epidermal revulsion marks me as soon to be dead<br>

For fear of infection - I'll be left to my fate<br>

Swollen piles leaking - infectious, discolored grue<br>

As my extremities contort beneath my gore-grizzled gaze<br>
Waking hours turned to nightmare as my senses decay<br>
And my blood drains to white, sickened unto the grave<br>
<br>
There's a ripening reek that emanates from my crotch<br>
And I dare not speak the horrid shade of the blotch<br>
That marks my face as one soon to be at death's door<br>
As I now become totally rotten to the gore - totally rotten to the gore<br>

“The security inspired by rank and wealth against these irreverent
intrusions on the sanctuary of the dead, is, as we all know,<br>
a mistaken confidence, since neither marble nor<br>
heraldry is a protection against such practices;<br>
for what the audacious atrocity of the resurrection-man cannot,<br>
the venality of the sexton certainly, will accomplish”<br>
Thomas Wakely, The Lancet newspaper 1832<br>
<br>
“'...a coffin was registered with the expressed purpose of<br>
frustrating the resurrectionists... designed to be made<br>
in cast or wrought iron, with concealed spring catches on the inner<br>
side of the lid to prevent levering, and joined in<br>
such a way as to thwart any attempt to force the sides<br>
of the coffin apart... Some parishes had communal mortsafes<br>
or 'jankers' – huge coffin-shaped pieces of stone or metal<br>
put on new graves.” - Ruth Richardson Death,<br>

“...when there is a difficulty in obtaining bodies, and their value is so<br>
great, you absolutely throw a temptation in the way of these men to commit<br>
murder for the purpose of selling the bodies of their victims.”<br>

Dr. Knox: ​Cold stiffs may fetch five sovereigns Warmer bodies a few<br>

Hare: ​The cemeteries crawl with sentries<br>
The sexton demands his bribe<br>
Graveyard gates ensure their entries<br>
Remain inhumed inside<br>
Yet another source of bodies<br>
Surrounds us every day<br>
Is not every soul but a corpse to be?<br>
And should we not just speed them on their way?<br>
<br>
Burke: ​Compunction be dashed<br>
Though this course may seem rash<br>

Hare: ​There's so much more profit<br>

real authors of the measure. It would have been well if this fear had been<br>
manifested and acted upon before sixteen human beings had fallen victims<br>

It required no extraordinary sagacity, to foresee that the worst<br>

has so long suffered to exist.”<br>
​The​ ​Lancet​ Newspaper, 1832<br>
<br>
“The inducement of this species of murder is the value of a dead body...<br>
[which] arrives from the scarcity of them in proportion to the demand...<br>
The scarcity of dead bodies for the purposes of dissection arises from<br>
a violent prejudice against dissection in the vulgar mind...<br>
This prejudice, against the conversion of inanimate flesh to the<br>
only useful purpose of which it is susceptible is fostered...<br>
in particular by the law, which directs that the bodies of<br>
murderers shall be 'anatomised'... for the express purpose,<br>
one might almost think, of strengthening the vulgar prejudice<br>
against dissection.”<br>

“That his class received him, in consequence of these horrid disclosures,<br>
