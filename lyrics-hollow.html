      <p class="lyrics-test-test">Left alone<br>
I am forced to stare at my reflection<br>
No longer able to hide so here's my confession<br>
Though I fear there is nothing left to save<br>
It's been ripped away<br>
<br>
How can I choose<br>
When I thought that I needed you?<br>
Just to move along in search of something new<br>
And still I fight to feel<br>
All of this is very real<br>
<br>
You can't save me from who I've become<br>
A mere shadow of my(fucking)self<br>
Breaking down from the inside out<br>
I will never be the same again<br>
<br>
And I remember<br>
The first time I looked into your eyes<br>
I knew right then you'd be my wife<br>
Somehow we lost each other<br>
But I thought we'd be together forever<br>
Now there's an emptiness inside<br>
One I must live with all my life<br>
<br>
Do you know how it feels to be empty?<br>
Do you know how it feels to be all alone?<br>
<br>
Look what you've done<br>
You tore my heart out and held it out in front of me<br>
If only to show the world how heartless you could be<br>
After all these years you've lied to my face<br>
Waiting for someone to come and take my place<br>
<br>
(After all these years you've lied to my face<br>
waiting for someone to come and take my fucking place)<br>
<br>
And I remember<br>
The first time I looked into your eyes<br>
I knew right then you'd be my wife<br>
Somehow we lost each other<br>
But I thought we'd be together forever<br>
Now there's an emptiness inside<br>
One I must live with all my life</p>

      <h1 id="f3" class="lyrics-test">-Caved In-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">I've been living in this nightmare<br>
Am I awake, or is this just a dream?<br>
I'm running blindly through the dark<br>
Something is chasing me<br>
I dare not look back<br>
Because if I do I fear for my sanity<br>
<br>
When I think I'm safe<br>
Life just proves me wrong<br>
I closed my eyes for a moment<br>
And everything was fucking gone<br>
Standing alone I'm hoping for the end<br>
Better than this misery that I've been force fed<br>
<br>
And still I can't recognize myself<br>
I'm not the person I was before<br>
Anger flows through my veins<br>
Polluting my soul<br>
Changing me into this beast<br>
That time can't erase<br>
<br>
Your broken promises<br>
I'll take them to my grave<br>
Consumed by all this rage<br>
I am the monster that you made<br>
There is a shadow<br>
It hangs above me<br>
And it's feeding on my will to live<br>
It stalks me to to my grave<br>
Surviving off my pain<br>
And all the shit you carved away<br>
<br>
I've tried to blame myself<br>
But I know deep inside I was too good for you<br>
So I take this pain and bottle it away<br>
And allow my anger to possess me<br>
<br>
This is the truth I must deal with everyday<br>
I can't look back or I'll lose my sanity<br>
And when it's gone<br>
I feel I will follow suit<br>
I'll strike a fucking match<br>
And you can watch me as I burn<br>
Your broken promises<br>
I'll take them to my grave<br>
Consumed by all this rage<br>
I am the monster you fucking made</p>

      <p class="lyrics-test-test">I've been living a lie<br>
Yet you don't even have the heart to tell me why<br>
How can you justify looking me in my face<br>
When you're the reason I have changed<br>
<br>
I feel so soulless<br>
My heart's been left out in the cold<br>
I've become so hopeless<br>
I'm facing all of my demons on my own<br>
<br>
And now I've kissed you goodbye<br>
With regrets of a life spent wasted<br>
And I'm just trying to find<br>
What it takes to make myself whole again<br>
<br>
Take your fake apologies<br>
And shove it down your fucking throat<br>
Choke on the words that you spew<br>
Poison from your worthless mouth<br>
<br>
I've been speaking in tongues<br>
With this noose tied around my neck<br>
All that it takes is one step<br>
To prove if I'm a coward yet<br>
<br>
I believed in your fucking lies<br>
<br>
There is a darkness deep inside of me<br>
A black hole so far down that I can't see<br>
What lies beneath the surface<br>
A creature that's begging to be set free<br>
And now I know how to fall<br>
Further than I've ever gone before<br>
There's no way back<br>
Not after I lost it all<br>
<br>
I've been living a lie<br>
Yet you don't even have the heart to tell me why<br>
How can you justify the reasons I have changed<br>
<br>
I feel so fucking soulless<br>
My heart's been left out in the cold<br>
I've become so hopeless<br>

      <p class="lyrics-test-test">I gave you everything<br>
And you threw it all away<br>
As if I meant nothing<br>
<br>
You're the cancer beneath my skin<br>
I swear that I'll never let you win<br>
It just goes to show<br>
Up is the only direction left to go<br>
<br>
I've lost my mind<br>
Trying to find a moment in time<br>
A place where I can reconnect<br>
When I'm no longer held against my will<br>
Shackled to these memories I have of you<br>
I've lost my fucking mind<br>
Searching for the reasons why I wasn't good enough<br>
How could I be so blind?<br>
After all the fucking shit you put me through<br>
<br>
And now I'm six feet underground<br>
And I'm starting to drown<br>
Beneath the weight of every mistake that I've ever made<br>
Struggling to pick up pieces<br>
As I claw my way back to the surface<br>
Will I ever be myself again?<br>
So fucking tell me<br>
Will I ever feel that safe again?<br>
<br>
I gave you everything<br>
And you threw it all away<br>
As if I meant nothing<br>
Was I just another trophy on your shelf?<br>
You're the cancer beneath my skin<br>
I swear that I'll never let you win<br>
It just goes to show<br>
Up is the only direction left to go<br>
<br>
You only have one life to live<br>
So make it count<br>
There's always room for second chances<br>
Just gotta learn to pick yourself back up<br>
<br>
This is the path that I've chosen<br>
And I refuse to be one of the broken<br>
A generation of damaged souls<br>
<br>
We are the lost<br>
We are the broke and unsettled<br>
Hide behind the words you won't say to me<br>
Try and erase memories I can't escape<br>
The reason for all my hate?<br>
Forgiveness is for the weak<br>
A plague planted within my mind<br>
The feeling hollows me<br>
But I'll sleep soundly at night<br>
Knowing karma will be bittersweet<br>
<br>
We are lost<br>
And I don't ever think we'll be found<br>
And now I know how it feels<br>
To be so close to the edge<br>
I'm afraid that I'm never coming back<br>
Unless I can learn to forgive<br>
But I can never forget<br>
I tried to forgive you<br>
I swear I've tried<br>
But I've got nothing left inside to give<br>
<br>
I gave you everything<br>
And you threw it all away<br>
As if I meant nothing<br>
Was I just another trophy on your shelf?<br>
You're the cancer beneath my skin<br>
I swear that I'll never let you win<br>
It just goes to show<br>
Up is the only direction left to go<br>
<br>
I've lost my mind<br>
I feel the hate insidev
It's growing deeper everyday<br>
The last piece of me dies<br>
You watch it fall and rot away</p>

      <h1 id="f6" class="lyrics-test">-Blackhole-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">Will you follow me down the path of no return?<br>
I'll be guiding the way with a single light<br>
As we move further from the day<br>
And into this never-ending night<br>
<br>
I forgot how it feels<br>
Walking hand in hand with you right by my side<br>
That's how it goes<br>
But I'm left wondering will I always be alone<br>
<br>
I've lost all control<br>
I'm spiraling down a hole that never ends<br>
Dreaming of time when it all made sense<br>
But now I'm falling even faster<br>
<br>
I wish that you could see<br>
You've destroyed every part of me<br>
That made me, me<br>
All of my hopes and all of my dreams<br>
Turn to ash right before my eyes<br>
And I'm left screaming<br>
<br>
You think you're better than me?<br>
It must be nice upon that pedestal<br>
You have created for yourself<br>
And when you're rising up<br>
I am falling down<br>
And when I hit the ground<br>
It won't make a fucking sound<br>
The silence is profound<br>
<br>
I just want to be free<br>
From this agony<br>
Because it's haunting me until the the day that I die<br>
I can't help laughing<br>
Because when I close my eyes<br>
I only see your face<br>
Each and everyday<br>
It's a face that I despise<br>
<br>
Someday things might possibly change<br>
Maybe I'll heal or maybe I'll stay the same<br>
Only time will tell if I can move forward<br>
Without taking steps back<br>
And get my life back on track<br>
<br>
And when I close my eyes<br>
I only see your face<br>
What a cruel trick my mind plays<br>
It's a face that I despise</p>

We've been sleeping awake<br>
With our eyes closed tight<br>
Drifting through time<br>
Like we're ghosts<br>
And searching for what's left<br>
Is what cost us the most<br>
<br>
This is the part<br>
Where I should tell you<br>
How good I'm doing<br>
How everything's okay<br>
But the truth is<br>
I can't remember the times<br>
When I felt anything<br>
Other than hatred and pain<br>
<br>
Are you one of the broken ones?<br>
Well join to the fucking club<br>
We're one in a billion souls<br>
Shunned by the ones they loved<br>
<br>
All the hope I feel it fading away<br>
Takes every part of me not to be afraid<br>
Don't fall asleep (Don't fall asleep)<br>
'Cause through your nightmares<br>
The demons will creep<br>
Along the way I lost myself<br>
Life fucked me over<br>
Like it does everyone else<br>
Don't fall asleep (Don't fall asleep)<br>
'Cause through your nightmares<br>
The demons will creep<br>
<br>
Come find me<br>
I'm hidden somewhere deep in the dark<br>
Walking aimlessly without my heart<br>
And only you can show me<br>
The way out of this nightmare<br>
Where I'm forced to remain in<br>
<br>
Please help me find my way out<br>
<br>
My fucking lungs are caving in<br>
And I'm suffocating<br>
As I claw my out of this darkness I've become<br>
I come from nothing<br>
A place I can hear all my demons scream<br>
There's no use in saving me<br>
<br>
All the hope I feel it fading away<br>
Takes every part of me not to be afraid<br>
Don't fall asleep (Don't fall asleep)<br>
'Cause through your nightmares<br>

Along the way I lost myself<br>
Life fucked me over<br>

But neither are you<br>
At least I had the decency<br>
To tell you the truth<br>
I once felt dead inside<br>
As if the world around me<br>
Withered to ashes and died<br>
<br>
Now there's a piece of me<br>
That's found the peace in me<br>
No longer lost<br>
But still waiting to drown<br>
Any second the bottom could just drop out<br>
And I'll be back inside this blackhole<br>
I just climbed out<br>
<br>
Show me now<br>
What's wrong this picture?<br>
When I've used every ounce of my strength<br>
Just to get better<br>
There's so much pressure<br>
That it's driving me insane<br>
<br>
So here's to waking up<br>
From this terrifying dream<br>
Cause the world around me<br>
Is not as dark as it seems<br>
I'll never say I'm sorry<br>
For being selfish<br>
Cause I'm living my life for me<br>
<br>
I found my backbone<br>
Lost it when I was under your control<br>
All it took was some clarity<br>
To show me I'm no longer the victim<br>
And I swear when I get the chance<br>
I'll walk away<br>
I'll disappear<br>
Like there's nothing left to lose<br>
<br>
It's kind of frightening<br>
When you're frozen in time<br>
And everything around you<br>
Keeps on passing you by<br>
The world doesnt stop<br>
Because we aren't living<br>
Take advantage of the gift<br>
The short-term life we've been given<br>
<br>
There is a piece of me<br>
A fucking place in me<br>
Where all my demons were fed<br>
With fucked up thoughts in my head<br>
Now I can see that they were never real<br>
As I begin to remember what it's like to feel<br>
<br>
So here's to waking up<br>

I'll disappear<br>
Like there's nothing left to lose<br>
<br>
I finally found my backbone<br>
No longer a slave to your control<br>
<br>
I'll be gone in the blink of an eye<br>
Vanish without saying so much as a goodbye<br>
Someday when you find my grave<br>
There'll be a message carved in the stone<br>
Just for you<br>

When we wore fake smiles on our face<br>
Pretending that we were happy<br>
When nothing could be further from the truth<br>

Trapped together<br>
To have and to hold<br>
In sickness and in health<br>
Until death do we part<br>

Like it had all been a dream<br>
Once so blind it was sickening<br>
I forced myself to move on<br>
And watched you fade away<br>

And even though I miss you<br>
That doesn't mean I need you in my life<br>
After everything we've been through<br>
It took me all this time to finally say goodbye<br>

To finally get a few things off my chest<br>

I wish the best for you<br>
Just thought you should know<br>
That I forgive you<br>
And not a day goes by<br>
When I don't wonder what my life could be like<br>
I guess we'll never know<br>
What we could've been<br>
Because the past is dead<br>

Nothing lasts forever<br>
That's what you said to me<br>
So let's mourn the ghost<br>
Of what we will never be<br>
Nothing lasts forever<br>
The words are always on repeat<br>
So let's bury the corpse<br>
Of what we were<br>
And finally be free<br>
<br>
And even though I miss you<br>
That doesn't mean I need you in my life<br>
After everything we've been through<br>
It took me all this time to finally say goodbye<br>
