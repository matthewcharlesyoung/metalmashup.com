I swear there will never be regret<br>

We thought love was everlasting<br>
Can we start again?<br>
What we had just can't be wasted<br>

Silent vows were broken<br>
And words that can't be taken back<br>
But you mean so much more to me<br>
Than anything I've ever known<br>
<br>
And this is the hope for tomorrow<br>
That today you will return<br>

Is there no solution?<br>
I realize my reflection<br>
My reflection is my demon<br>

You gave but it was not enough<br>
Your strength, it was not enough, never enough.

Rush to the heart, drain it from the soul<br>
Come face to face with all you can't escape<br>
Will you hold your ground or turn away<br>

Salvation sings and shows us all we know<br>
The road is treacherous and lonely<br>
Filled with the empty inventions of the soul<br>
Under disillusion, run from confrontation<br>
Or do we heed the judgment call?<br>

Release your inhibitions and answer to the call<br>

Leave behind this shell of flesh and bone<br>
In the end we will answer to the call<br>
The burning question remains - how much is too much to give?<br>
Do your wings have the strength to carry on?<br>
When we see redemption, how long will we wait for deliverance?<br>
It takes everything to keep from falling now<br>

Define your ascension<br>
<br>
As the tension builds within you<br>
Let conviction conquer<br>
All those who stand before you<br>
<br>
This is fair warning<br>
No turning back<br>
There is no indecision<br>
<br>
Don't turn away<br>
Your time has come<br>
<br>
It all ends today<br>
Your time has come<br>
<br>
Draw your breath<br>
Define your ascension<br>
Put your fears to death<br>
Define your ascension<br>
<br>
(this is fair warning)<br>
(your time will come)</p>

            <h1 id="ff13" class="lyrics-test">-Reignite-</h1>
            <p class="lyrics-test-test">In modern humanity<br>
We lack a sense of urgency<br>
Where lies our ambition (our ambition)<br>
Speaking words that don't hold weight<br>
Lack of pure integrity<br>
Leaving nothing to be gained<br>
<br>
Nothing but insincerity<br>
Just masking insecurity<br>
<br>
Where's the passion<br>
The urgency? Where is vitality?<br>
<br>
Hanging on by a thread<br>
Fading spark of light within<br>
Reignite the ignition (the ignition)<br>
<br>
There is no greater defeat<br>
Then not fighting for what you believe<br>
For what you believe<br>
<br>
What do you believe in?<br>
What do you stand for?<br>
It's time to back, back up your words<br>
(live this life) with passion<br>
Has the world drained all our hearts?<br>
Has the love been torn apart?<br>
(live this life) with new direction<br>
With knowledge to maintain<br>
To determine what must change<br>
<br>
With positive mentality<br>
An attitude that sustain<br>
Reignite the ignition<br>
<br>
Yeah!<br>
<br>
(live this life)<br>
It's in your hands<br>
(it's our time)<br>
Take nothing for granted<br>
(take this life)<br>
It's in your hands<br>
(live this life)<br>
Stand and fight<br>
<br>
Reignition<br>
Ignite the blaze

            <p class="lyrics-test-test">[Special Edition Bonus Track]<br>
<br>
Triumph through tragedy<br>
<br>
Every decision<br>
Every choice that we make<br>
All it takes is just one victory<br>
Or just one simple mistake<br>
<br>
To change the course<br>
Count the loss<br>
Determine the road that we must take<br>
The road that we create<br>
<br>
(strength will be)<br>
Through the determined<br>
(can't you see)<br>
There is triumphs through tragedy?<br>
<br>
Cause us be<br>
There's no illusion<br>
This life will drag you through so much despair<br>
Draw your own conclusion<br>
Through reason and purpose we persevere<br>
<br>
To change the course<br>
Count the loss<br>
Determine the road that we must take<br>
The road that we create<br>
<br>
(strength will bleed)<br>
Through the determined<br>
(can't you see)<br>
We have a purpose<br>
All we need is to believe<br>
There is triumph through tragedy<br>
<br>
Never give in<br>
To despair and hopelessness<br>
Never give in<br>
When your will begins to break<br>
Never give in<br>
<br>
Yeah!<br>
<br>
When you're on the edge (step back) to find your balance<br>
When the walls are closing in (closing in) tear them down<br>
<br>
(strength will bleed)<br>
Through the determined<br>
(can't you see)<br>
We have a purpose<br>
All we need is to believe<br>
There is triumph through tragedy</p>

            <h1 id="ff15" class="lyrics-test">-Loyalty-</h1>
            <p class="lyrics-test-test">[Special Edition Bonus Track]<br>
<br>
"Justice for my sister and her children"<br>
"If you want justice you've come to the wrong place"<br>
"I disagree. I want to bring those who have wronged me to<br>
justice and all those who've wronged me are right here"<br>
<br>
The Queen brings the vengeance race<br>
Fight from the fledged<br>
Passing through the blood red sun<br>
You're the watchers in the southern skies<br>
<br>
Fighting until our last breath<br>
Feel this indenting death<br>
Through honor and victory<br>
We will be avenged<br>
Avenged<br>
<br>
Loyalty unto the grave<br>
Unbowed, Unbent<br>
We are unbroken<br>
<br>
Fucked up to blood and to fight<br>
Choking on these venomous voices<br>
We overcome our enemy<br>
Until all are vanquished<br>
<br>
Flames course through the darkness<br>
For life to be avenged<br>
Through honor and victory<br>
We make amends<br>
<br>
Loyalty unto the grave<br>
Unbowed, Unbent<br>
We are unbroken<br>
Loyalty until the grave<br>
Unbowed, Unbent<br>
We are unbroken<br>
<br>
Sever these venomous voices<br>
Voice from the pain<br>
My death won't be in vain<br>
Loyalty until the grave<br>
<br>
Loyal until death<br>
Loyal to the grave<br>
Loyal until death<br>
Loyal to the grave<br>
<br>
Loyalty unto the grave<br>
Unbowed, Unbent<br>
We are unbroken</p>
