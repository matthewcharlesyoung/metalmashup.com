It's a sacred sort of disorder how these sisters came along<br>
Of flocks of fools, and dozens of men<br>
Who fell through their thrones into the abyss of again<br>
The kings of earth, crippled with crowns<br>
And the cursed criminal who turned it upside down<br>
<br>
So we shout, "Hold us together, tear me apart"<br>
May our suffering sing the hymns we couldn't hear<br>
"Hold us together even if it tears me apart"<br>
May our blood be spilled for the life of this world<br>
<br>
"Do you feel whole? Will you see my face?"<br>
You are, I'm not, but you are<br>
Dead to conceive life that tells out stories<br>
<br>
"Hold us together, tear me apart"<br>
May our suffering sing the hymns we couldn't hear<br>
"Hold us together even if it tears me apart"<br>

Forgive me, Lover, and forget my sullen face<br>
Privilege brings us to this place of human currencies<br>
We buried our sisters in a glass display<br>
Only to evaporate to a toxic skyline<br>
Underneath we sell off the bodies<br>
<br>
My body became a graveyard where they buried thirsty souls<br>
Show me your righteous leader; I'll show you the bullet holes<br>
The preacher with the parched tongue and the "God" that he controls<br>
"Shake off the sin, shake off the sin"<br>
And spit out your cacophony of lies<br>
<br>
I'll climb through your screen<br>
And bleed out the image you left in me<br>
<br>
But God, are you man? Then how do you see me?<br>
From where you sit up in heaven, looking down on my hell<br>
My body chokes back<br>
"I have nothing to draw with and the well is deep<br>
Where can I get living water?"<br>
<br>
Enslaved in the "Land of the Free"<br>
My prison is our wedding bed where you left me for dead<br>
You'll leave us for dead<br>
Apathy was our anchor to a digital sea<br>
Where you drown in the comfort of our complicity<br>

Can Love save me?<br>
Will Your wrath avenge us?</p>

Cracks in the clouds leave me wondering<br>
Did the oceans dry out and return to the sky<br>
For a privileged perspective of our final goodbye?<br>
<br>
Pretend it's a house of peace while she's buried underneath<br>
You built your Father's house over my mother's grave<br>
<br>
Bodies; a mass grave collapse the concave floor<br>
These sanctimonious steeples will meet us in the dirt<br>
Because the earth is trembling<br>
If only we had eyes to see it shake<br>
Ignorant until we expire<br>
<br>
When the ocean fills our veins and the soil becomes my bones<br>
Maybe we'll fall asleep tonight to the madness<br>
In the melody poured out for slaves<br>
<br>
We were dressed in potential now we're draped in sorrow<br>
Our race is a bloodstain spattered on a profane political campaign<br>
Manifest your destiny<br>
Stripes and stars comprise my prison bars; the cost of liberty<br>
<br>
Maybe we'll fall asleep tonight to the madness<br>
In the melody poured out for slaves<br>
Maybe this storm is a perfect score for wretched bodies washed ashore<br>
Poured out for me<br>
<br>
The life I loved looking up at me<br>
Saplings struck like daggers hemorrhaging streams<br>
As the breath of my people return to the ground<br>
So forests can once more abound<br>
<br>
The suffering cross that overcame<br>
The name of love made concurrent with shame<br>
<br>
This melody; I thought it familiar<br>
It sounds like your heartbeat keeping time<br>
Then you turn and remind me that this pain has a purpose<br>
And maybe we'll fall asleep tonight</p>

To furnish us with fire<br>
But jealous hands fashioned their cross to a sword<br>
Brandished their gift as a torch to burn the light<br>
To the dead we owe only the truth; the human condition<br>
Surveying the space between the nave<br>
I saw my own infernal grave; existential imperfection<br>
We sat scrawling out notes on scratched oak tombs<br>
Bullets bouncing off stonewall saints laid to rest<br>
By our Forebear at their children, at the dissidence of despair<br>
This proximal milieu could close the door<br>
To the closeness that keeps us inside the spaces that we hide<br>
My heart burns cold as life leaves my daughter's eyes<br>
I am the mother of the dying, the dust, the denouement<br>
How can absence take my father's house?<br>
How can nothing take my daughter's life?<br>
Walk me out from this tomb<br>
If you are the gate could you make a way?<br>
Come down from that cross; hold out your hands so I can see<br>
<br>
"Je suis sorti vivant du four crématoire<br>
Je suis le témoin sacré de l'église<br>
Je suis une mère qui a tout perdu"<br>
<br>
This fire burns your name on my lips; this smoke chokes your song on my throat<br>
Now let death lynch my lungs I offer what's left of this withering tongue<br>
But oh, no exit so bright as the light that shines behind the Son<br>
I leapt through stained glass saints to fall to the garden where we first begun</p>

Made king of all the wastes<br>
And forever will swallow us alive, we'll be abstracted from time<br>
We can let the tides wash over<br>
<br>
This is the epilogue to the introduction<br>
Lost in the sound<br>
Hold tight all your systematic theories<br>
That help you to sleep at night<br>
But remember that there could be no sufficient certitudes in hell<br>
<br>
Father, forgive them for they know not what they do<br>
Mother, receive me because I'm coming home to you<br>
Does this cup run dry?<br>
<br>
Look at what we've done again<br>
We wage war in the name of love<br>
Using gold to fill the holes in your hands<br>
<br>
Caught in the paradox; juxtaposed between bifurcated black and white<br>
And my propensity to fail you<br>
Caught in the cyclical narrative of violence<br>
That invokes your name to justify genocide<br>
They'll take everything<br>
<br>
We traded water for salt<br>
Something whole for something equally as broken as us<br>
Now dying of thirst we'll write this out in blood<br>
And shut you in a stone cold time where the air rots out<br>
Leaving us alone<br>
We chose to be alone<br>
I was given to cup to quench parched<br>
Tongues<br>
But I became drunk and lust lynched my lungs<br>
<br>
Father, forgive them<br>
For they know not what they do<br>
Mother, receive me, because I'm coming home to you<br>
Does this cup run dry?<br>
For they know not what they do</p>

      <p class="lyrics-test-test">My hand, held to the glare of this burnt impasse<br>
Yours, necessarily on the other side of some sickly meta-xis<br>
You're stopped in stasis, matched with mine<br>
I'll quantify time with meter<br>
With rhyme to calculate a way to prove that you are alive<br>
<br>
Isolated, trapped between<br>
A picture of you now stained on the street<br>
Oh mother, teach me how to die<br>
In your shadow I saw to a distant future<br>
Your life was only a nominal fee<br>
Singing the sound of silence, signaling the end<br>
They took your life, mother, as a pretense to pretend<br>
The hand that feeds us sat you down<br>
Covered my eyes, thrusted the styli<br>
Retraced the timeline to call it suicide<br>
<br>
Will you wait for me?<br>
<br>
Death was the chorus; our lives framed in refrain<br>
Softly we sing notes better sung by our dead<br>
I'd rather sleep and see you soon than die alone<br>
In the wake of this nuclear catastrophe<br>
We were meant to create, you spoke us out of nothing<br>
Out of the chaos we've caused<br>
Naked we came, shadows we leave<br>
<br>
Salt of the earth: Preserve their songs<br>
Light of the world: Burn out the shadows<br>
<br>
Infinite echoes of stifled screams<br>
The abyss you've created will ever stare back into me</p>

Sister, can you see me through the boundaries of this garden?<br>
When every man will take your voice, every God will fate your end<br>
You planted paradox in the center of our humanity<br>
My ambivalent proclivity for insufficiency<br>
<br>
Should I sleep or should I die alone?<br>
Life to death or flesh to decompose<br>
You captured me<br>
<br>
I'm awakened by a fate that screams<br>
"You will bear the weight to give this world<br>
A beating heart that never ends"<br>
Now bring me a love that will live and die by my every word I speak<br>
Won't you lie in this bed that we have made?<br>
I must become something more than this<br>
<br>
Should I sleep or should I die alone?<br>
Life to death or flesh to decompose<br>
You've captured me<br>

Who promised heaven without God<br>

If we had sight to seem to see the seven seas<br>
Could cease to be or freeze in me<br>
We'd shake this sudden sundering<br>
And subsequently cross the strait and traverse the wastes<br>
We'll beat our rifles to shovels<br>
Aand dig a proper grave for our sons who saw the end<br>
Of God, wasteland<br>
The flag will fall with the wall we built, wasteland<br>
<br>
Apostate to the State, Witness to the Dead<br>
For you know only a heap of broken image<br>
And when you rid this earth of God we shall shelter Him underground<br>

Fall into the coldest wastes of humanity<br>
Darkening circles fed by deepening graves<br>
"Death solves all problems", your heart is a statistic<br>
No mother, no resistance, but still she precludes the grave<br>

In a midnight reverie of which I'll never wake<br>
That started mundane enough with an incessant tapping<br>
On the windowpane separating me from the storm<br>
<br>
Where inside I sat, me the loathsome fool<br>
With my head cocked sideways in confusion<br>
As my looking glass³ became a two-way mirror<br>
And you can watch me hide from everything on this living sphere<br>
But don't you dare darken my doorstep<br>
Stranger; never a step more, no, no, nevermore<br>
You see, I have this reoccurring dream<br>
Where we snuck past scores of slumbering guards<br>
And fixed that rustic iron key to that lock to set you free<br>
"I would bring you liberty!"<br>
Where in reality I'm a coward<br>
I'm collateral matter swayed by banalities of time and space<br>
I'm a name without a face<br>
<br>
My trepidation reached threshold and my terror turned to madness<br>
When I awoke I was swinging at shrouded silhouettes<br>
And stumbled out the door where my anger<br>
Was extinguished by this downpour<br>
Compelled, void of volition, my steps propelled through this chronic storm<br>
Where there in the clearing; throughout the gaps in the trees<br>
Dark smoke flickered from fire illuminating my unease<br>
Like clockwork, seven sisters turned together in a circle<br>
Autonomy abandoned, they moved singular and perpetual<br>
Around a dark blue flame where I heard you call my name<br>
"I am the fire that is never quenched<br>
And I am the river that will not run dry"<br>
<br>
When I slept in that garden<br>
Lord did you see me as I was dreaming?<br>

This is the end of everything<br>

After the sacred kissed the profane<br>
When you came and left again<br>
Such a captivating pain<br>
After that night I left my comfort<br>
To find where your body lies<br>
I'd wander upon this grave then fall<br>
I'd fall inside<br>
<br>
I searched the clearing for that spark, hands sifted through the ash<br>
Knowing what we felt was real but some delusions never pass<br>
So I took shelter in the woods with the naked shaking trees<br>
Deciduous, fraternal twins, we're both wilted, stem and leaf<br>
<br>
Then the mist turned sleet turned snow<br>
My senses shook numb, I've nothing to show<br>
But a rain-stained book that once contained my literary charades<br>
New blots of ink, archetypal shapes and shades<br>
Bleed through each and every page and I ask myself<br>
What's the weight of my life on the scales of eternity?<br>
<br>
We inherit the earth, we inherit the war<br>
I inhabit the wound, I dwell in the harm<br>
Oh, how far we fall; we're casualties of time<br>
Oh, how far we fall, begin to forgive existence<br>

Retreat back from reaching trees<br>
When a frigid shadow climbs right inside of me<br>
That specter of recompense<br>
It's a sound I've heard ever since<br>
<br>
Amidst the endless mortal strife<br>
And the constantly dying light<br>
The truth we felt from the start<br>
"How can I hold myself together when everything falls apart?"<br>

We inherit the earth, we inherit the war<br>
I inhabit the wound, I dwell in the harm<br>

Forgiving one another<br>

Tides receding<br>
Death ran away then life flooded in world<br>
This I am: imbalanced<br>
Beautifully so, hands connected, perhaps<br>
Then dead reflections saw You<br>
I did, didn't I?<br>
<br>
I didn't, did I?<br>
You saw reflections dead then<br>
Perhaps, connected hands<br>
So beautifully imbalanced: am I this world?<br>
In flooded life then ran away Death<br>
(Receding tides)<br>
<br>
Another one forgiving, another one eclipsed<br>
Sun Brother, Moon Sister, sinking helplessly<br>
Depressive then manic, nothing forgiving me<br>
Is there even myself, splitting? You see me see You<br>
<br>
Illusion of shelter: that brokenness was bought<br>
"We all reverse the cursed death called time," said this about me<br>
Reveals creation, all fleeting now but immortal<br>
First Father told You, "Autonomous am I"</p>

Watching crowds like crows<br>
We furiously flock to tragedy<br>
Observe the hurt then hasten back<br>
To our peaceful, quiet nests of blasphemy<br>

Scapegoat, rather die and know<br>
Drag your failing body in tow<br>
Witnessing the wake<br>
Conflagrate the ready oil at the stake<br>

Binging, the culmination of purging<br>
What our lusts have borne<br>
We hoarded all the world<br>
To find we'd lost any semblance of ourselves<br>

I'll be pale to match the walls<br>
And warped to trace the beams<br>
Flushed to fit across the floor<br>
So you can step right over me<br>
Scouring this filthy slate<br>
These crooked bones they won't break straight<br>
Cracked and splintered like our house<br>
Upended by that first summer squall<br>
<br>
Fading, so thin, you could snap me into the shape you need<br>
Gaunt enough to slide through that wedding dress<br>
Then stitch me to a fraying matrimony<br>
Embalmed inside a never-ending ceremony<br>
<br>
I am not my own reflection<br>
I am not myself, I am not myself<br>

Faint flickerings across the cavern in our minds<br>

Fading out, fading away<br>
Burning in a bliss you can't sustain<br>
<br>
Am I a hedonist or solipsist?<br>
Barbiturate tourniquets<br>
Drip, drip; a sycophant's sea of delusion<br>
Drowning in an empty conclusion<br>
<br>
Come shoot me up into the night<br>
<br>
Blood Moon; the shadow in my skin<br>
The window of my soul was sealed but I'll still let you in<br>
Blood Moon; shiver through my mind<br>
Only the need is real, feel whatever I can to ensure I can't feel<br>
<br>
All the hell in my veins<br>
Can't dissipate the pain<br>
All the hell in my veins<br>
Won't wash away your face<br>
<br>
So let us go then, you and I<br>
Watch the sky drift into sleep, etherized<br>
Collapsing stars, condemned to their cosmic graves<br>
Bleeding light for the gain of some far off race<br>
<br>
The fog hangs like thieves, there must be guilt in these streets<br>
Place your hand on my wrist, it's not like we'll be missed<br>
Do I dare shake the need from our skin?<br>
Do I dare rattle the rust corroding me within?<br>
<br>
The lechery, the treachery, oh come, Love, sit next to me<br>
This anatomy is built like tragedy<br>
Don't you know me by these scars, these marks where I are?<br>
I mean I am, I mean I was, I was supposed to be someone<br>
<br>
Blood Moon; the shadow in my skin<br>
The window of my soul was sealed but I'll still let you in<br>
Blood Moon; shiver through my mind<br>
Only the need is real, feel whatever I can to ensure I can't feel<br>
<br>
Every fix is a prayer, every high a sacrifice<br>
We worship desire at the altar of dependence<br>
<br>
I hit the bottom then it hit me back<br>
<br>
Incarnation of society<br>
"The face of evil is the face of need"</p>

          <h1 id="t10" class="lyrics-test">-Firstborn (Ya'aburnee)-</h1>
          <p class="lyrics-test-test">You bury me<br>
<br>
Glass clouds shed their autumn skin<br>
Kiss the mourning stems as they bow to the wind<br>
Heads hung like wartime mothers<br>
As the congregants struggle to console one another<br>
<br>
We're bandaged together, soothing the surcease<br>
Huddled inside the fog, beneath the barren trees<br>
Budding youth, unfettered by absolutes<br>
Do branches wither first when there's blood on the roots?<br>
<br>
Can you stretch a moment into a thousand?<br>
"Away from the quiet collapse of it all"<br>
I know the Know who knows you, I see the See who sees you<br>
I'll follow you into forever<br>
<br>
I memorized your pain<br>
I put my thoughts inside your name<br>
Little Light, can't you see?<br>
You're supposed to be the one who buried me<br>
<br>
I tried to stop the flood<br>
I tried to pull you from the tide<br>
Now you paint the sky with distant fire<br>
<br>
The room lay quiet, sowing silence<br>
Watching lifelines stream through wilting arteries<br>
Dreams crash with awe behind your roving eyes<br>
How I envy the calm that occupies your mind<br>
<br>
Drifting just above the flatline<br>
That keeps your thoughts displaced from mine<br>
I can't divert the current<br>
I divide and wash ashore<br>
<br>
I'll try to write you to rest<br>
Plant you inside my prose<br>
Yet my resolve, does it shake<br>
Beneath a four foot casket shadow<br>
<br>
The ink has spilled across the page<br>
Shaping surviving sun to shade<br>
Valleys and peaks, in grief<br>
Descend into a ceaseless sleep<br>
<br>
See how the night unfolds<br>
Constellations welcome you home<br>
Adrift in the river beyond our memories<br>
You bury me<br>
<br>
I memorized your pain<br>
I put my thoughts inside your name<br>
Little Light, can't you see?<br>
You're supposed to be the one who buried me<br>
<br>
I tried to stop the flood<br>
I tried to pull you from the tide<br>
Now you paint the sky with distant fire<br>
<br>
I memorized your pain (I memorized your pain)<br>
I put my thoughts inside your name (Thoughts inside your name)<br>
Little Light, can't you see? (Can't you see?)<br>
You're supposed to be the one who buried me (You bury me)<br>
<br>
I tried to stop the flood (You bury me)<br>
I tried to pull you from the tide (You bury me)<br>
Now you paint the sky with distant fire<br>
<br>
(You bury me)</p>

          <p class="lyrics-test-test">Bind the wrist, cut the tongue,<br>
call it Liberation<br>
Bind the wrist, cut the tongue, call it Liberation<br>
<br>
Invader, you dare make me a stranger<br>
Invader, you brand me as a traitor<br>
<br>
These borders were forged in loss<br>
Painted with a martyr's forgotten blood<br>
Legions of stone infecting the land<br>
Legions we carved into the palm of God's hand<br>
<br>
Stigmata cities stitched together with wails intent<br>
On sanitizing the sedition of our dark traditions<br>
We begin with the purest of intentions<br>
Then fabricate the cruelest inventions<br>
<br>
Interpret the subtext: S-O-S<br>
Euthanized with euphemistic lies<br>
Populace of blank binary minds<br>
Appetite for endless apathy<br>
<br>
Breathing in, in insecurity<br>
<br>
Until you see your reflection through the scope of a weapon<br>
Nothing will ever change<br>
A revolution stirs in the silence<br>
The movement defies this negative space<br>
<br>
I hear you through the noise<br>
The truth that speaks in silence<br>
Scale the divides we devise<br>
We locked out thee world but we're locked inside<br>
<br>
I hear you through the noise<br>
The hope sung from the margins<br>
My heartbeat just a step behind<br>
I didn't know your name but I knew we were out of time<br>
<br>
Nuclear families split apart like the atom<br>
Demagogues proliferate the calloused grip of the state<br>
The future asphyxiates under nativist suspicions<br>
Insipid minds, domestic fission<br>
<br>
Bind the wrist, cut the tongue, call it Liberation<br>
Bind the wrist, cut the tongue, call it Liberation<br>
<br>
Thirteen, cold as a stillborn<br>
Wounds still warm in his chest<br>
Behold the crimson lens, peer through the gaps in the flesh<br>
Bullets raining from Babylon; the price of wealth<br>
<br>
How can you resist this cycle<br>
If you can't resist yourself?<br>
<br>
What a world we knew before we fearfully withdrew<br>
To our silent cells of solitude but still I hear you, I hear you<br>
<br>
I hear you through the noise<br>
The truth that speaks in silence<br>
Scale the divides we devise<br>
We locked out thee world but we're locked inside<br>
<br>
I hear you through the noise<br>
The hope sung from the margins<br>
My heartbeat just a step behind<br>
I didn't know your name but I knew we were out of time</p>

          <h1 id="t13" class="lyrics-test">-The Anatomy Of Time (Babel)-</h1>
          <p class="lyrics-test-test">Certain was the fear trembling in<br>
your father's chest<br>
Encountering the ancients in a graveyard for those who never rest<br>
Even the wind lay still as time<br>
Revealed the fools we are<br>
<br>
Quiet monoliths appear, suspended in the air<br>
Solemn in their countenance, impervious to fear<br>
Marveling at the symmetry that binds and brings us here<br>
Separating threads of space, distinctions disappear<br>
<br>
Take all of your answers, throw them in the flames<br>
I'll keep the questions, I'll take the rain<br>
Defend all your doctrines, those lies you had sworn<br>
I'll wander through the night, I'll sleep in the storm<br>
<br>
I'll follow you to the end<br>
I'll weather the world (I'll sleep in the storm)<br>
I'll follow you to the end<br>
Where time has no beginning<br>
<br>
I pulled the past apart, futures unraveled with its plans<br>
To my chagrin, the answers felt hollow in my hands<br>
Adorned with memories that form the tapestry of life<br>
Collective accounts of consciousness from virtue to vice<br>
<br>
"Where are you now?" My voice echoed in that canyon<br>
I turned to find you lynched, choking with abandon<br>
The scope of time, at first profuse, now twisted to the shape of a noose<br>
We wanted to see forever but instead we saw the truth<br>
<br>
Species of the nightmare<br>
People of the dream<br>
Language is your prison, but also the key<br>
Confront the heart of fear, behold the shape of destiny<br>
<br>
Spinning in the circles, waltz with the sun<br>
There's no time, many turn to one<br>
<br>
Take all of your answers, throw them in the flames<br>
I'll keep the questions, I'll take the rain<br>
Defend all your doctrines, those lies you had sworn<br>
I'll wander through the night, I'll sleep in the storm<br>
<br>
I'll follow you to the end<br>
I'll weather the world (I'll sleep in the storm)<br>
I'll follow you to the end<br>
Where time has no beginning

          <h1 id="t14" class="lyrics-test">-Depths III-</h1>
          <p class="lyrics-test-test">I knew one truth and that truth was the sea<br>
Cold and knowing, it saw the coward in me<br>
And as the stain of epochs lines my tongue<br>
I choked heavy on the past, too numb to speak back<br>
<br>
We're each abandoned by the hands of time<br>
That set us down to sail circles across a straight line<br>
Sister moon, are we all that's left?<br>
Just a silent satellite and the sigh of flesh<br>
<br>
Come down and rest your lunar head on my breast<br>
Listen to the terror tear at my chest<br>
Our masts in tatters, oars shattered, feel free to pull me back<br>
To the vast, unforgiving mass<br>
<br>
Should we call this art, my falling apart?<br>
The tangents of an imbalanced heart<br>
As matter multiplied, I divide but I digress<br>
The deprivation is taking effect<br>
<br>
You said if I stood against my darkness<br>
Not all of me would die<br>
But all I see on the surface is a shadow<br>
And it occurs to me this could mean suicide<br>
<br>
When you went quiet I turned to silence<br>
Seven sisters draw me back across the moor<br>
Could you still love me in my leaving?<br>
Would you remember me by the moments we forgot?<br>
<br>
And as the waves slapped at my raft<br>
I cursed the fate, like our vows, they broke at the bow<br>
Flanked by the mist, I inhaled the breath of existence<br>
Then you called me for one last time<br>
<br>
I am the wind, the Be and the Still<br>
I am the Depths, the Immeasurable Will<br>
And when I awoke in that Garden<br>
Lord, did you see me as I was dreaming?<br>
<br>
I locked eyes with the storm, the sky sank down<br>
To receive the fury of the sea<br>
The abolition of my being<br>
The precipice of eternity<br>
<br>
Incandescence burst through the black<br>
The veil was torn as the void collapsed<br>
The rains will subside, be my eyes<br>
Show me hope in the maw of the night<br>
<br>
Our fractured pasts fall into one<br>
A dozen stars collide as a perpetual sun<br>
And as we disintegrate<br>
Will you be the Fire that burns in my lungs?<br>
<br>
Breathe me in<br>
Watch me burn<br>
Come breath me in, breathe me in<br>
You'll watch me burn</p>

Don’t get us wrong though, while we all love a bit of Metallica and still lose our shit every time Hetfield sneezes or Lars manages to keep time, we just feel that there is more to our clan that needs to be celebrated.</p>
