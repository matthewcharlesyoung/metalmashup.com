      <p class="lyrics-test-test">You're scarlet soaked and bold<br>
and the sheep's eyes locked to mine, sink to my bones.<br>
Though your lips still drip, intentions,<br>
they keep me wanting more...<br>
It's rising against all the walls we built for falling.<br>
All the walls we built just stand<br>
in vain to draw you near.<br>
It's the wool to hide the wolves.<br>
And under these toes from where<br><br>
we last spoke, Your words laid so firm.<br>
But I did not shed that skin like You said.<br>
When the mason neglects the mortar,<br>
looks become deceiving<br>
and when the bricks start to fall,<br>
I'll be the one crawling down this road so dark.<br><br>
Vices like vipers<br>
Speak in whispers.<br>
My heel's the meat to sink their teeth,<br>
Like the viper I kept when You said, "Let go!"<br>
This is what it took for me to see.<br>
WHEN I AM GOD this church is unsound.<br>
Slithering in the shade of a sinking church,<br><br>
Surprise is no excuse for<br>
the traps that you left in the wake of warning.<br>
So this is the warning,<br>
you fall to learn.<br>
And to the girls,<br>
You're worth more than the cheap words.<br>
You see your body as beauty, but your pulse is worth more.<br>
Hear me, it's not what it seems,<br>
though the feeding tastes of honesty.<br>
This is the warning,<br>
you're just a hit to coax my urgency.<br><br>
Why do we keep what holds us?<br>
Why do I keep what holds me down?<br>
Lose the weight of defeat.<br>
It's time to stand your ground!<br>
Vices like vipers<br>
Speak in whispers.<br>
My heel's the meat to sink their teeth,<br>
Like the viper<br>
I kept when You said, "Let go!"<br><br>
Since all the alibis of ignorance are void...<br>
This, my lust, the pornos and the sluts.<br>
Take, my lust, this world's love.<br>
Great Counselor, take what's left.<br>
Great Counselor, take what's left of me.</p>

      <h1 id="f2" class="lyrics-test">-I Will Welcome The Reaping-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">Like maggots,<br>
they breed with headlines,<br>
dining the wounds in breathless cadavers.<br>
Mirror blind and aimed for gold,<br>
Now watch a terror turn on its own.<br><br>
They race and they race to<br>
the carcass rot to feed.<br>
And just past decay, this design<br><br>
delivers life, but they prefer to play cancer.<br>
In chase for the sky, towers uprise.<br>
In fear, the earth quakes for what's forgot.<br>
They cut like the butchers with pride<br>
as their cleavers, as the tide prowls their shores.<br>
They never listened when we screamed,<br>
"Wash the blood from your hands!<br>
Rip off the veils! Wash the<br>
blood from your hands and run,<br>
see what you forgot!"<br><br>
Then the clouds met the sands as the cyclones began.<br>
In epic charge rose the hordes,<br>
all branches and thorns.<br>
As the stone from their<br>
walls broke legs as they crawled,<br>
The stars had no mercy,<br>
they screamed for blood in their fall.<br>
Six eyes pierce the night and now...<br><br>
24 teeth in each of the<br>
3 makes 72 white knives your new ending.<br>
With every slaughter<br>
bring your kingdom home.<br>
How are we deserving<br>
this pain we are feeling?<br>
How are we deserving<br><br>
this pain with healing?<br>
And on trails these<br>
symphonies of agony...<br>
Cant you see? We're still demanding self-pity.<br><br>
Look to the moves of<br>
the things surrounding.<br>
We're the only ones,<br>
the only ones who keep from growing.<br>
One day the reaping will return,<br>
and we'll be butchers no more.<br>
Bring this slaughter home,<br>
and send everything above.</p>

      <h1 id="f3" class="lyrics-test">-We Are The Archers-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">We watched them fall.<br>
Eyes locked to mine, feeling as if I had let them down.<br>
Caught blinded by silk, led by lips to the baited chains.<br>
Now look around regret.<br>
As the axe swings before your eyes,<br>
think how everyday we spent dreaming.<br><br>
Never once did we pick up the sword and learn to fight.<br>
Now is the time. Pick yourself up and fight.<br>
Learn to swing. Learn to swing.<br>
They watched me fall for the last time,<br>
but how is such an elegant blade to be stopped?<br>
When in times where eyes set<br>
sites to cross-hair the weak.<br><br>
My bride, I'll try, oh so hard,<br>
to find that Light.<br>
But in his mind she baits me to fire.<br>
What a cunning foe we've met!<br>
Our horizons pushed pages away to a new fight,<br>
A new method, new plan. But how do I train?<br><br>
How do you ready a child for war?<br>
Oh what a cunning foe we've met!<br>
The Captain, what will He send?<br>
I know He will send, but what will be sent?<br>
I can feel a slip. A buzzard scrapes nearby,<br>
as I atop this hill, stand and scream.<br>
It's all I can do to control<br><br>
my gaze from the curiosity of seeing myself as prey.<br>
And then I heard an armored march.<br>
I heard an armored march that shook the trees.<br>
Bows bent as they sang,<br>
"WE ARE THE ARCHERS!"</p>

      <h1 id="f4" class="lyrics-test">-Charlatan's Host-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">Sleep takes its hold with a sinking pull.<br>
And now that I'm alone, this burst of light<br>
fills my lids and I'm awake to the songs of horror.<br>
Your ill-bought greatness, he's seen it all from the frame.<br>
One day you'll reap the seeds of a shadowed past,<br><br>
and I can only hope I'm there.<br>
You tried to satisfy<br>
the thirst of a thousand ages,<br>
But built a stack of bones as<br>
your monument to dead vanity.<br>
It's just a shrine to the words<br>
you use to wreck. Tell me, How can you sleep?<br>
How can you just welcome the<br>
wine and throw out your nets?<br>
You throw out your nets and set<br>
fame to bait the noose.<br><br>
Set fame to derail whats innocent.<br>
Why spare the life of inglorious waste?<br>
Why let him live?<br>
He's just hunting your own!<br>
How can you just sit there and watch?<br>
"Because i love you more than you know<br>.
Look again and tell me what you see!"<br><br>
In the window was me.<br>
The massacres were all me!<br>
Oh God, please! Please!<br>
deliver the penalties for all of this from me.<br>
I'm not finding justice,<br>
no warrant for mercy...<br><br>
don't give up on me.<br>
Don't give up on me!<br>
What happens when I turn<br>
and run again? And again, and again?<br><br>
"I will forgive you."<br>
And what happens when I lie to your face?<br>
"I will forgive you."<br>
Oh my God, I can be<br>
so defiant to some one<br>
who's arms stretch to me.<br>
"I will forgive."<br>
Don't give up on me! Don't give up on me!<br><br>
"I have forgiven you!"<br>
I'll awake to new purpose to fight this body.<br>
No longer will I play the dark shepherd.<br>
Let not my words be<br>
ripped from the throat of a horror.<br>
Oh, forgiver!<br>
Where is justice in letting me live?</p>

We came from the dead and dying.<br>
But the moment you pulled,<br>
You brought us back to the living.<br><br>
Stand here to a world at war.<br>
This blacken field leads to ruin.<br>
Ruled by folds pulled tight, and a pit so slick...<br>
Draw your lines, let nothing cross. No!<br>
What booming hate moves close,<br>
so vast that the clouds would follow?<br><br>
What looms, with thunder?<br>
And the water did fall.<br><br>
The turn of earth to mud.<br>
Once dried veins, now fill and swell.<br>
Lift the torches, light the fields!<br>
We stand as the giants make way.<br>
We stand as the giants make way.<br>
We are the few to shed the fold,<br>
we are the few!<br>
Oh, sweet lit clarity grant<br>
us the eyes for this bane.<br>
Towered beasts now meet our lines...<br>
But fast on the wind came a song,<br>
and you turned.<br><br>
The lines crossed now charge.<br>
The lines crossed but you turned away.<br>
It was a beautiful song,<br>
sung through beast's jagged teeth.<br>
It's not real. You'll see.<br>
It's not real. You'll see. You'll see.<br><br>
She's the touch that you want,<br>
the soft wet skin that haunts.<br>
Deep inside a warmth that<br>
lies on a bed, she's calling to you...<br>
Fight from your knees and the giants will fall.<br><br>
...taste the wine of her lips,<br>
feel free to taste this kiss.<br>
And drink deep and forget the<br>
struggle in the battle you live.<br><br>
Don't turn we need you.<br>
Don't turn I need you God.<br>
The sirens are calling your name!<br>
Come back. Come back.<br>
Make the call. Make the call.<br>
Father, send Your rain. Send Your rain.<br>
Lay waste to the kings here.<br>
Lay waste to their grip<br>
and we'll rise. We will rise.

head down, in a pale grey scene.<br>
Every step leads to atrophy.<br>
This body made for conquest,<br><br>
instead a pawn on a stage so worthless.<br>
I saw the future as endless reaches.<br>
The skyline's promise, has left me faced with.<br>
Who's dreams are you killing?<br>
And who's pockets are you filling?<br>
Are you where you said you would be in the end?<br>
I walk alone through the crowds<br>
of past failed kings.<br>
Auditions were called for the<br>
hope-thirsting sheep.<br><br>
What keeps this family of<br>
fighters from facing the war that they were bred for?<br>
Who's dreams are you killing?<br>
And who's pockets are you filling?<br>
Are you where you said,<br>

But will it quench? Because it never does.<br>
Oh our crest is the same,<br>

        <p class="lyrics-test-test">[feat. Cody Bonnette of AS CITIES BURN]<br>
<br>
Rest I have not found...<br>
They keep coming, keep coming,<br>
keep crawling right through my teeth.<br>
They keep coming, keep coming,<br>
your children I feed off to keep awake...<br>
Long enough to meet the next little sheep...<br>
Long enough to meet the<br>
next to buy every word I preach.<br><br>
It's like I was born to<br>
rip the flesh from her bones.<br>
I'm forever stalking the streets for the next one.<br>
I've found I can run faster,<br>
faster than guilt could ever.<br>
I've found once a man lets<br>
virtue aside he finds sweet what follows.<br><br>
I've found that I can<br>
run faster than guilt could ever.<br>
"I'm bleeding while you're leading for my enemy."<br>
How could you really<br>
think that I am worth this rescuing?<br>
I wish I could be so much more than me.<br>
"You could be the one who pleases me.<br><br>
You could be,<br>
because I can reach through anything."<br>
I wish I could be so much more than me.<br>
"You could be the one who pleases me.<br>
You could be... my arms are reaching."<br>
You're reaching out to a dog that's tasted and turned.<br><br>
Why? Why waste your time<br>
when I've found my strength in another?<br>
Can you see more in me?<br>
Can you really see more than just a beast?<br>
"I'm bleeding so you can be the one who pleases me!"<br>
I'm sorry,<br>
but I just can't justify this rescuing.<br>
"You can't see fairness as your clarity.<br><br>
The better man is what your heart wants to be<br>
but you rape every trusted chance I bring your way.<br>
If justice you seek,<br>
in death it should be."<br>
I wish I could be so much more than me.<br>
"You could be the one who pleases me.<br>
You could be,<br>
because I can reach through anything."<br>
I want to believe.<br>
Will you take me?<br>
"You could be the one who pleases me.<br>
You could be,<br>
my arms are reaching."<br>
I don't want to be the<br>
father who has to watch his daughter<br>
be conned and stripped bare by a monster like me.<br>
God, put me to sleep.</p>

        <h1 id="s4" class="lyrics-test">-Breathing Blood-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Regaining consciousness<br>
under a swinging moon,<br>
he speaks of alliances that<br>
beckoned me long before the womb.<br><br>
I've caused more wounds than I'm worth. I see now,<br>
you must not have heard...<br>
I am the natural born killer.<br>
There is freedom past your history.<br>
"This air won't fill my lungs!"<br>
Because you should be breathing blood.<br><br>
See, this death, it was your victory so...<br>
"Teach me to fill my lungs!"<br>
...never stop breathing blood.<br>
I had it all so very wrong,<br>
but I fought... I fought with only song.<br>
God, I've tried... I'm trying<br>
like a beast all alone,<br>
but my words... my words have aired in poison.<br>
Please teach me how to breathe<br>
because this air keeps failing my need.<br>
Fill my lungs with what won't<br>
bleed from my enemies.<br><br>
He said, "If death is victory<br>
how afraid of life can you be?"<br>
I'm born a war machine not<br>
knowing which beckon to heed.<br>
Will I rise as a tool for<br>
glory or be lost in dormancies?<br><br>
I've regained consciousness<br>
under this swinging moon.<br>
You filled my lungs and each<br>
breath heals this killer's wounds.<br>
There is freedom past your history.<br>
"But this air won't fill my lungs!"<br>
Because you should be breathing blood.<br><br>
See, this death, it was your victory so...<br>
"Teach me to fill my lungs!"<br>
...never stop breathing blood.<br>
I hear him speaking to me.<br>
For the first time he cleared my head<br>
that's when he said,<br>
"Only cowards keep dormant<br>
their sleeping strength,<br>
and soon you'll find,<br><br>
only the fearless will reach their potential's peak."<br>
(What will wing these words<br>
if even the air is poisoned?<br>
If the air is poisoned,<br>
what will wing these words?)<br>
"Tell me, if death is victory<br>
how afraid of life can we be?<br>
If death is victory how<br>
afraid of life can we be?"</p>

        <h1 id="s5" class="lyrics-test">-Reveries Of Flight-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">A sound ahead from distant peaks,<br>
a song that all my brothers sing.<br>
It's just out of reach, to join I<br>
would need the wings the heaven denied me.<br>
It's like you're deaf to my voice,<br>
but I've been here for every moment,<br>
waiting on your call to move.<br>
If you could just make a choice,<br>
I know you would find me<br>
wanting only to be close to you.<br><br>
"You keep denying my lead!<br>
Because I've tried,<br>
I've never pulled back my reach,<br>
and I've stayed and I've died,<br>
but you keep looking for me where I'm not.<br>
I won't be just where you want me to be.<br>
You've got to believe and<br>
just trust that I can be everything."<br><br>
It's like you're deaf<br>
to my voice "but I'm not!"<br>
but I've been here for<br>
every moment "and I've fought"<br>
waiting on your call to move "just call to move"<br>
if you could just make a choice "oh I have"<br>
I know you would find me wanting "I just want..."<br>
only to be close to you "all of you."<br>
If you would just try and let<br>
(me) pry all your grips on worries,<br>
I would come alive in your life and<br>
let you find the flight you're longing.

        <h1 id="s6" class="lyrics-test">-World Without A Sun-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">I fear a world without the sun.<br>
The day the sun never rose, cold swept the world.<br>
And now stone and ice, the children she forms.<br>
I lift my eyes to take in horizons of skin.<br><br>
The cold is creeping to meet with<br>
wrath above and you'll soon be<br>
fearing to see what it kept us away from.<br>
I fear a world without the sun.<br><br>
I fear a world without the sun,<br>
but never who wished it gone.<br><br>
The trees are dead, yet alive more than ever,<br>
growing flesh where once were leaves.<br>
They stretch instead of tower,<br>
like bone wrapped giants they reach.<br><br>
Oh, but nothing stirs like the fire's thunder.<br>
The cold is creeping to meet<br>
with wrath above and you'll soon be<br>
fearing to see what it kept us away from.<br>
I fear a world without the sun.<br>
I fear a world without the sun,<br>
but never who wished it gone.<br>
And now the ground pulses, constricting for birth.

        <h1 id="s7" class="lyrics-test">-The Fire Dawn-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Stand up, we'll be more than kings.<br>
Show no mercy when the gates swing.<br>
I've said it before but without accepting<br>
that my body was the only thing keeping me from living.<br>
I wouldn't even let the surgeon touch me.<br><br>
Though facing death, I dined on flesh...<br>
but now I live to fight outnumbered.<br><br>
I live to fight outnumbered at<br>
the fire dawn to live in rebellious honor.<br>
I'll stand, you'll see me over all of your fallen.<br>
I'll be knee-deep,<br>
knee-deep in a sea of their organs.<br>
Send me all of hell and I'll face them,<br>
I'll face them one on one-thousand.<br><br>
Stand up, we'll be more than kings.<br>
Show no mercy when the gates swing.<br>
Breathe deep the sea at your knees.<br>
Breathe deep and show no mercy..<br><br>
With blistering heat, the army now bursting through,<br>
blinds me with a light not meant<br>
to empower but reigned to devour.<br>
I'll face them one on one-thousand.<br>
This kingdom's end is written,<br>
I'll take it one on one-thousand.<br><br>
I'll stand, you'll see me over all of your fallen.<br>
I'll be knee-deep, knee-deep in a sea of their organs.<br>
Send me all of hell and I'll face them.<br>
I'll face them one on one-thousand and yell,<br>
"Is there no one else?<br>
Is there no one else left?"</p>

        <h1 id="s8" class="lyrics-test">-A Banquet For Traitors-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Again, I wake to you...<br>
Stand up, these feet are so far from clean.<br>
I'm undeserving of the strength in your arms used to save me.<br>
But years passed when I saw Eve next to me,<br>
she's wrapped in low-cut, dripping sensuality.<br>
I remember the host,<br><br>
but it's been so long since we spoke.<br>
He said, "My son, you can hold perfection<br>
in your arms if you wish."<br>
but I sit at a banquet for traitors<br>
placed here between a thief and a liar.<br>
"Just run and hold perfection in<br>
your arms as I slip..."<br>
but I'll make you the god of a<br>
liar cause I've been both a saint and a viper.<br><br>
I'll make you the god of a liar.<br>
I am a lie, just like these traitors<br>
that cry for forgiving replies<br>
but keep their grips held tight.<br>
Though my eye's on Eve you're ready<br>
to bleed as if I'm royalty<br>
but I am no king. I am no king.<br>
His life spilled like a tide so divine.<br>
It was a blood soaked feast that<br>
never ceased as his veins dripped empty.<br><br>
With such violent grace, the waves<br>
hit my face and in painful clarity I turned fearfully...<br>
"What makes you think you can deserve me?<br>
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU CAN DESERVE ME?"<br>
My host fell to His knees as paling lips pushed His plea...<br>
"My son, you can hold perfection<br>
in your arms if you wish."<br>
but I sit at a banquet for traitors,<br>
placed here between a thief and a liar.<br><br>
"Just run and hold perfection in your arms as I slip..."<br>
but I'll make you the god of<br>
a liar cause I've been both a saint and a viper.<br>
By grace uneven, at the banquet portrayed,<br>
through death, this life is saved.<br>
But I am no king! I am no...<br>
"Open your eyes, child, your sea is changing."</p>

        <h1 id="s9" class="lyrics-test">-Commissioned By Kings-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Give me your eyes so I can see through fire.<br>
Give me your strength so I can stand so strong...<br>
Now we walk on leathered skin to freedom.<br>
The tempest roars but I am fearless.<br>
With each step I crack and<br>
stretch and each breath is a sting to my chest.<br>
My God, will this push bring purity or...<br>
Bring out the dead! Bring out the dead!<br><br>
Bring out what you will have bow down,<br>
and they will bow down.<br>
"They're climbing,<br>
they're climbing through soil and earth."<br>
They have my scent!<br>
"but you can stop them, I'm sure..."<br>
Yes, I can best even the devil himself<br>
"...but your pride has just made it worse.."<br>
What writhing spite is unearthing here?<br><br>
Why choose from prodigals a band<br>
of cowards to hoist your banner of love for the world to the slaughter?<br>
"Just a crack, the smallest of<br>
laws and your legs have now failed you to crawl.<br>
You're, from the dirt, insurgent<br>
to warning, from lion to nothing at all.<br><br>
Look and see, you're feeble and weak<br>
for your body fights only your heart.<br>
Call to me and unleash the strength,<br>
your soul will begin to roar."<br>
Give me your eyes so I can<br><br>
see through fire.<br>
Give me your strength so I can stand so strong...<br>
I breathe in your light and<br>
like fire my colors now light.<br><br>
Though outnumbered by lines,<br>
we'll stay and fight.<br>
When we reach the gates all you'll hear us say is,<br>
"Bring out the dead! Bring out the dead!"<br>
Bring out what you will<br>
have bow down and they will bow down.</p>

        <h1 id="s10" class="lyrics-test">-The Finisher-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Do you mean to challenge me?<br>
Because your speech is<br>
threatening to the writer of your history,<br>
through a future perverted by envy.<br>
Your whisper may sway the weak,<br>
but when I speak it roars the sea.<br><br>
Your challenge has been met,<br>
because with a breath I could snap your neck.<br>
This won't be like the first<br><br>
time you tried, because my<br>
patience and mercy for you has run dry.<br>
You've watered among my bride<br>
and started seeds to feed your throning flight.<br><br>
I will sing to the world your<br>
storm is capturing and the angels will join me...<br>
We will sing to a world reborn from suffering.<br>
But mark my words, because if that<br>
tree keeps them from seeing me<br>
I will burn off your limbs and<br>
you will never shade again.<br><br>
You will bow at my feet or I'll<br>
rip out your knees and make of your face all the carnage you crave.<br>
I am the Finisher and I am Forever.<br>
I will sing to the world your<br>
storm is capturing and the angels will join me...<br>
We will sing to a world reborn from suffering.<br>
From the armories the angels sing.<br>
You will see them end this suffering.<br>
From the armories the angels sing.<br><br>
You will fear them when they lift their wings.<br>
They will sing to a world reborn.<br>
They will sing as I cut off your horns.<br>
I'll cut off your horns.

If the blind can see you<br>
And the lame can meet you<br>
Will the dead embrace you if<br>
you never gave them the means to believe?<br>
And that makes no sense to me<br>
<br>
He gave me a voice that speaks out<br>
But paired it with a mind that’s filled with doubt<br>
If I’m to find the sun<br>
I need something more than song<br>
to pull me from this cave of questioning<br>
<br>
Give me sand to build a home<br>
And watch all the walls fall on me<br>
I can’t change what I am<br>
Lions always kill the lambs<br>
Don’t you see the irony?<br>
Don’t you see the irony?<br>
<br>
If the blind can see you<br>
And the lame can meet you<br>
Will the dead embrace you if<br>
you never gave them the means to believe?<br>
And that makes no sense to me<br>
<br>
Will I embrace you?<br>
Will you ever give me the means to believe?<br>
Answer me… please.</p>

          <p class="lyrics-test-test">It makes me sick that it's<br>
hard to distinguish<br>
An honest leader who preaches a cause<br>
That's not made, and not based<br>
On the profit they'll receive from telling the world<br>
What line divides you from the seeders<br>
Who sow without growing believers<br>
You point and you judge<br>
Forgetting that their<br>
faith is molded by your lead<br>
<br>
So where am I to find<br>
A voice that's pure in urging me to climb?<br>
There's gotta be more, there's gotta be pigs<br>
I've joined them and clawed at the ground for my feed<br>
I've seen bloodshed but the words still remain<br>
I left, I fled, I called, I cursed<br>
I changed from "certain" to "searching"<br>
But nothing has answered deserving faith<br>
<br>
You are not alone in the eye of the darkest storm<br>
We are the lighthouse shining a lamp from the shore<br>
To bring your journey home<br>
You are not alone, use this song to lead you home<br>
We are what's left of the love<br>
that can pierce through the callous<br>
Life you've spent undone<br>
We are the legacy that's left<br>
to breathe the winds to sail you home<br>
You are not alone<br>
If you can hear this song<br>
The battle has been won!<br>
<br>
Don't go, don't go!<br>
I've got to use your voice to light the way back home<br>
'Cause I need to see, I need to breathe<br>
So much more than my kind is offering<br>
Where am I to find<br>
The voice that keeps urging me to climb?<br>
I need to hear it again or I'll<br>
lose sight of land and be<br>
swept past my chance to survive<br>
<br>
Follow your pulse to the shallows<br>
Unleash your will to survive<br>
Make every step draw you closer<br>
To be the hero you've always denied<br>
<br>
Where is your voice coming from?<br>
Show me a sign I can trust<br>
I need something more to believe in<br>
A beacon or something to merit pressing on<br>
<br>
You are not alone in the eye of the darkest storm<br>
We are the lighthouse<br>
shining a lamp from the shore<br>
To bring your journey home<br>
You are not alone, use<br>
this song to lead you home<br>
We are what's left of the love<br>
that can pierce through the callous<br>
Life you spent undone<br>
We are the legacy, that's left<br>
to breathe the wind to sail you home<br>
You're not alone<br>
If you can hear this song<br>
The battle has been won!<br>
<br>
Spread wide your wings<br>
Let the draft lift you up<br>
You've heard the call of the future flock<br>
You're coming home

He's got the voice of a con,<br>
The same one<br>
Who cut down in the name of his God,<br>
Who took on the robe of a judge,<br>
Without a license to kill without cause.<br>
He's not worth it.<br>

so many years of silence.<br>

And the daughter watches father,<br>
As he sleeps and dreams, she brings the knife to light.<br>
'Cause she knows he can't go farther,<br>
And he'll never wake to see his daughter cry.<br>
<br>
Don't lose control or you will long<br>
To go back to this time and rewrite your thought.<br>
'Cause you're about to choose what's to come,<br>
So ironic, it's ironic, it's ironic<br>
that you're contemplating murder<br>
While I'm educating you in mercy!<br>
You say you want, you say you want,<br>
The means to believe, so don't change who you are,<br>
'Cause who you are is how I made you to discover me!<br>

The steel marries his skin.<br>
No, it's not worth it, it's not worth it.<br>
(I cut him down! I cut him down!)<br>
He didn't have to fall, it's your fault,<br>
It's your fault. You lost control,<br>
And now you long to go<br>
back and rewrite your thought.<br>
But I won't let you slip away.<br>
Not this time, not this time.<br>
This time you're gonna learn<br>
what it means to receive the very mercy<br>
That you denied when you denied<br>
The means to believe,<br>
I'll keep feeding you the proof that you need,<br>
But you spit it out to follow further your doubt.<br>

And now he can't go farther,<br>

All the guilt and the shame of the games I played<br>
Deaf to my heart starts to fade<br>

I plead and scream, "Come what may!"<br>

Dear God, lift me up from this ground of pain<br>
The heat has reached a degree that's bringing me to faint<br>
My faith and sweat have remained to contend the grave<br>
Despite the sting, we wait until you bring our fate<br>

We're singing<br>
We are the children of fire<br>
We are the lions<br>
We stayed when all else deserted<br>
Because we were born to fight and fight and fight<br>

I see you, tattered and bruised<br>
You're the only ones who remained true<br>
I hear your call through the thick of it all<br>
You've waited so long for the rescue<br>

It turns from blue,<br>
The sky comes unglued<br>
It falls to the earth as my answer<br>
It's so far from rain, the lot will feel pain.<br>
As it singes their skin but for you it will soothe<br>

What descends feels like heaven on my skin<br>
Finally I am free to never breathe again<br>
My body lifts from the ground I was rooted in<br>
And I pass the spark as it races to the rest of them<br>

We are the lions<br>
We stayed when all else deserted<br>
