We are created from flesh and blood<br>
We stand beside a King for the world to see</p>

        <h1 id="s9" class="lyrics-test">-Ecstacy-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">The world we crave bleeds perfect blood<br>
We suffer from freedom, in every choice we make<br>
And every wound we seek.<br>
We couldn’t wait for perfect love,<br>
Finding what we needed in a blink of an eye<br>
And a turn of the page<br>
<br>
I feel like it’s over<br>
Enraged through my dying shame<br>
<br>
Burst, we burst through the cycle<br>
The same song played over again<br>
Screaming never again until my heart’s content<br>
Who will save me from myself?<br>
The look on our face reeks of pleasure and pain<br>
Masked in endless shame<br>
<br>
I gave her everything,<br>
she left me wrecked and on my back<br>
I gave her everything,<br>
swallowed in hate that I created
</p>

        <h1 id="s10" class="lyrics-test">-Still Small Voice-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">You are my my everything<br>
Bruised and broken<br>
I need you, sweet serenade<br>
You see our pain and you feel it<br>
<br>
Hands tightly clenched on a wall of remembrance<br>
As your life slowly hangs by a thread<br>
Now every choice bares its consequences<br>
Baring truth to every lie you’ve ever made<br>
<br>
I stand before you helpless<br>
You see my faith put to flight<br>
Can you hear me?<br>
<br>
Step to the edge of your final warning<br>
Loving the filth yet afraid of the fall<br>
One day I believe you’ll be stronger<br>
Living free as a constant reminder<br>
<br>
Know in your heart that you’re living a lie<br>
Playing the part watching your life pass by</p>

We are the hope<br>
We are the faceless<br>
We are humanity<br>
<br>
Make me a god and turn us creator<br>
How foolish am I<br>
Look at us and what we’ve become<br>
We’re losing sight of humanity<br>
<br>
By the hands of man<br>
Though you can’t understand<br>
Will it last you forever<br>
You are full of lies<br>
Denied by all of your pain<br>
Will it last you forever<br>
<br>
No more questions<br>
So follow me<br>
Stripped of consequence<br>
No questions asked<br>
Blinded by false hope<br>
You are the great I am<br>
<br>
Consequences stripped blinded by false hope<br>
You see the face of their god<br>
This creation has become the creator<br>
You see the face of my God<br>

We are the creation<br>
You see the face of my God

Through the lines of a mine field<br>
Find a pulse beneath the dive bomb<br>
Social reform will never bury me<br>
<br>
God give me the strength to carry though<br>
We'll battle on we will battle on<br>
Stand firm in the light of his Son<br>
We'll battle on we will battle on<br>
<br>
It burns within us<br>
Holding all we know<br>
Let him heal you<br>
<br>
So hold me in your arms<br>
And let me dwell within your favor<br>
Lead me through the fullness of you<br>
Never let go<br>
<br>
Even when my flesh takes over me<br>
We'll battle on we will battle on<br>
We trust in the heart of his Son<br>
We'll battle on we will battle on<br>

I will stand in the midst of his design<br>
Culture revive humiliation of my condition

Set me on fire<br>
Kill the pain<br>
Tear out my fear<br>
<br>
Choke the fear from my heart<br>
Falling through this world<br>
Break the chains that bind me<br>
Watch it burn away<br>
<br>
Show me how we can protect them<br>
Overwhelmed by hate<br>
Will I learn how to reach you<br>
Overwhelmed by hate<br>
<br>
Fear of what the world will think<br>
Shattered by death and truth<br>
Crossed over the constant<br>
Fear of my repentance<br>

Blind by rage<br>
Buried alive<br>
Rise and fall<br>
Carried through death</p>

          <p class="lyrics-test-test">Your spirit is in conflict<br>
Idle hands are driven by your own design<br>
Baptized in the blood of the innocent<br>
Here's your god here's your god<br>
<br>
You played your selfish game<br>
And reached a tipping point<br>
Enslaved by deception<br>
My God is everlasting<br>
Enslaved in a world of impurity<br>
<br>
Here is your platform of<br>
Mass destruction<br>
Pointing your finger like you know me<br>
Only believing in the one true God<br>
And your pride shall come as they fall<br>
<br>
We are bound by honor and integrity<br>
God give us the courage on this battleground<br>
<br>
You wanted to save me<br>
You promised and told a lie<br>
I feel like it's over<br>
We are drowning<br>
<br>
Cover me<br>
<br>
The false peace only brought you pain<br>
Shifting the blame and feeling the pressure<br>
In the moment in every moment<br>
These idle hands have made you a slave

We find ways to hide our attention<br>
Fall down on your knees<br>
Find fault in the lines of addiction<br>
<br>
Cuts become the violation<br>
Defined by the edge of a knife<br>
And broken and worthless I am worthless<br>
Defined by the edge of a knife<br>
Will this nightmare end<br>
<br>
Now turn away<br>
I’m dying inside<br>
I’m breathing without you<br>
I’ve fallen before<br>
<br>
Now turn away<br>
<br>
Take the gun fill the clip your choice now cock it<br>
You scream release<br>
One life nothing more in this reality trip<br>
You scream my God my God my God<br>
<br>
Take a step back<br>
<br>
We are the voice<br>
We are the voice of the broken<br>
<br>
Bow down to your knees<br>
Burn through the ashes

Crawling back to the god you've become<br>
<br>
What you face is a constant reminder<br>
To the pain that you caused with your flesh<br>
<br>
Severely devoted to myself<br>
Revealing it all in a moment<br>
Why can't you wait why can't you wait for me<br>
And hold me through the storm<br>
<br>
You'll pay the price<br>
She's crawling back to you<br>
You'll pay the price<br>
Buried alive in the depths of a mine field<br>
<br>
Choke imbalanced waves of imperfection<br>
Your world has now been broken<br>
Flesh is the breath of her affection<br>
No rest when you're abandoned<br>
<br>
Will you save me from myself before I break<br>
I will surrender to your name before I break<br>
<br>
Rip your soul from the inside<br>
Looking at us to forgive to forgive<br>
Tear your soul from the inside<br>
Life is a trap when you're abandoned<br>
<br>
It grabs your soul<br>
While ripping you<br>
From the inside<br>
She's crawling back<br>
<br>
Pride will be the curse of your destruction<br>
The truth is buried within your heart</p>

          <p class="lyrics-test-test">Shut your mouth burst through insanity<br>
Controlling the minds from the moment of conception<br>
Holding the youth in the peak of their innocence<br>
Crawling around in the dark for weakness<br>
Shedding light in the home feeding corruption<br>
Breathing death instead of life in full motion<br>
<br>
Pride comes before the fall<br>
Open your eyes before the lies sink in<br>
God give them eyes to see<br>
Dying inside burn through integrity<br>
<br>
Will they ever see through deception<br>
Balancing beneath insecurity<br>
I will never lose my connection<br>
Following throughout all eternity<br>
<br>
Fill the void of the cross with broken dreams<br>
It's a play to rip you from reality<br>
Give us strength let them see what they've done to me<br>
Don't let them be swept away by society</p>

          <p class="lyrics-test-test">The final conflict of our moral right<br>
Expectations becoming dead straight to the core<br>
<br>
Look into the mirror<br>
I am responsible<br>
Look into the mirror<br>
My reflection is what I've become<br>
Staring straight right through the heart<br>
<br>
Liar plagued by your sin<br>
Forgiven redeemed by the blood of the lamb<br>
<br>
From the moment of creation<br>
Our roles are not reversible<br>
Society kills our relationship<br>
Driving a wedge between us<br>
<br>
I will never be held down<br>
By your false belief<br>
We rise to our feet<br>
Making a stand<br>
For the world to see<br>
<br>
Stay the course<br>
As the pressure falls on you<br>
Never back down<br>
Revived by the flames<br>
As the heat holds you in<br>
<br>
Fight through the emotion<br>
Reaching the highest depth<br>
Reach down to me<br>
Set me on fire<br>
Setting your spirit free

The fear the fear is crippling<br>
Truth purged by evil<br>
Prepare your hearts for war<br>
<br>
Crawling in the depths of your freedom<br>
Waiting for your death amidst the battlefield<br>
<br>
Forcing yourself to play the victim<br>
Lies of separation<br>
<br>
We are rebellion<br>
Fight through corruption</p>
