Werebeast breathe life once more<br>
Through nothing we've come crawling<br>
Fighting, ripping, biting, mauling<br>
Monster of the river van<br>
Turning wolf from man<br>
Remove sword from jaw<br>
Devour all<br><br>

Hello old friends, now snuff the lights<br>
Our howls like music in the night<br>
Under moon we turn and shed our skin<br>
Rise from your grave yet once again<br>
The immortals call, rejoin our pack<br>
Through ice and flame to hell and back<br>
Hoist the badge, raise the flag<br>
We bury teeth in throat<br><br>

With silver bullets in your gun<br>
You pray you can defend<br>
Against the cursed the utmost worst<br>
The wolves they thirst for them<br>
They thought that they could cage<br>
Like we were dogs, like we'd obey<br>
Sent them all six feet beneath<br>
With bones we pick our fucking teeth<br><br>

The group has changed since last we met<br>
Hungrier these hounds of set<br>
Insatiable and voracious<br>
We feed on every thing<br>
The weak the strong did eat<br>
This town picked clean, just rancid meat<br>
Feral animal inside<br>
When one wolf dies the pack survives<br><br>

Like frost we creep, the cold we seep<br>
Into your youth corrupted<br>
Wall of growls the only sounds<br>
Weapons of blast destruction<br>
Under our moon your mortal wound<br>
We leave all asunder<br>
Blood wont thaw for wolves are law<br>
We shred with tooth and claw<br><br>

At the edge of dark we lie and wait<br>
The reason why you lie awake<br>
At night and stare into the black<br>
These starving eyes are staring back<br>
And your children we have bitten<br>
In this record message hidden<br>
Pour the gas, light the match<br>
Beast calls from fire<br><br>

Do not deny embrace wvlfside<br>
Shape shift and become this<br>
At the altar of the beast<br>
Wolf clan can not be fucked with<br>
Lock the doors, nail the boards<br>
We're waiting out there like the freeze<br>
Waiting for our chance<br>
These wolves hunger for the feast<br><br>

Thrown to the wolves once more<br>
On battlefield we're born<br>
With spear and claw we bare our teeth<br>
Besiege your walls, run red your streets<br>
All the blood we spill, never get our fill<br>
Kill this world like a disease<br>

Step out of the light<br><br>

Angel wings we rip from back<br>
This oath to black<br>
With apex eclipse<br>
And all shall align<br>
Gathered your forces<br>
Await your sign<br><br>

Recite the text, and speak the hex<br>
Oh father of lies we place our hand<br>
Through time and space until all ends<br>
With these words we summon him<br><br>

666<br>
In your name dark lord we speak<br>
Heavens light forever pierced by night<br>
With this unholy rite<br>
We shall bring god to his knees<br><br>

666<br>
Conjuring the blackest fiend<br>
King of hell, Satan hear our spell<br>
With fang of wolf, we shall feast upon the sheep<br><br>

666<br>
Feel the serpent's breath in me<br>
There is no christ, no paradise<br>
Your king is dead</p>

        <h1 id="s7" class="lyrics-test">-Coffin Crescendo-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Wretched soul<br><br>

Beneath the depths of this ocean a life once lost omit<br>
This movement slowing down fluent motion<br>
Rebirth now you submit<br>
Inside this weakened vessel surrendered unto me<br>
Now feast your eyes upon the blackened sea<br>

Fear is for the living for the dead feel less than nothing<br>
Echoed screams resistance<br>
Eradicate your existence<br>
Boat mans price afterlife, river of infinity<br>
Pray my deeds outweigh my greed, secure my place eternity<br><br>

These hell fires incinerate<br>
Lay face down in the mourning fields<br>
Bathe in guilt disintegrate<br>
Inside this fucking hatred there is no remorse<br>
This is where filth comes to suffer<br>
This is where death comes to rot<br><br>

The darkest abyss beyond the river of the gateways<br>
Into morrow we enter this kingdom of pain and death<br>
Agony calls out to me and there is nothing left<br>
Of pain and death theres nothing left<br><br>

Beyond the bounds of time, depths cloak the edge<br>
Shadows reaching from the dark, taken forsaken we are<br>
My bastard son what have you done for you have surely lost your way<br>
Through the burning gates of the damned<br>
You are damned, damned like me<br><br>

Beyond the bounds of time, depths cloak the edge<br>
Shadows reaching from the dark, taken forsaken we are<br>
My bastard son what have you done for you have surely lost your way<br>
through the burning gates of the damned<br>
You are damned, damned like me<br><br>

These hell fires incinerate<br>
Lay face down in the mourning fields<br>
Bathe in guilt disintegrate<br>
Inside this fucking hatred there is no remorse<br>
This is where filth comes to suffer<br>
This is where death comes to rot<br><br>

The darkest abyss beyond the river of the gateways<br>
Into morrow we enter this kingdom of pain and death<br>
Agony calls out to me and there is nothing left<br>
Of pain and death theres nothing left<br><br>

Beyond the bounds of time, depths cloak the edge<br>
Shadows reaching from the dark, taken forsaken we are<br>
My bastard son what have you done for you have surely lost your way<br>
Through the burning gates of the damned for you are damned like me</p>

        <h1 id="s8" class="lyrics-test">-Where Dead Angels Lie-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">In the dawn an angel was dancing<br>
surrounded by an aura of light<br>
But in the shadows something was watching<br>
and with patience awaiting the night<br>
"Mournful night, attractive night,<br>
your dark beauty obsesses me"<br>
An angel bewitched by the shadows<br>
Seduced by the whispering lies<br><br>

A spell was cast and the sky turned red<br>
The angel's heart froze to ice<br>
The blackness that falls is coming to stay<br>
Under the snow lies angels so cold<br><br>

Dusk has passed and a cold morning breeze<br>
is sweeping all over the plain<br>
On the ground lies an angel with skin so pale<br>
On her face an image of pain<br>
Snow is now falling to the frozen ground<br>
The angel is covered by white<br>
Frost is spreading across the plain<br>
to welcome the eternal night<br><br>

The dress is white with crystals of ice<br>
and frozen roses so red<br>
Roses of blood from an innocent soul<br>
On the plain lies an angel dead<br><br>

A spell was cast and the sky turned red<br>
The angel's heart froze to ice<br>
In the gloomy sky black clouds were gathering<br>
The silence was broken by cries<br>
A spell was cast and the sky turned red<br>
The angel's heart froze to ice<br>
In the gloomy sky - The silence where dead angels lie<br><br>

Touch the snow... caress the lifeless sculptures<br>
Die!<br><br>

The blackness that falls is coming to stay<br>
Under the snow lie angels so cold<br>
Yet with each crystal of frost that is falling<br>
another story is told<br>
A spell was cast and the sky turned red<br>
The angel's heart froze to ice<br>
In the gloomy sky - The silence where dead angels lie</p>

        <h1 id="s9" class="lyrics-test">-Upon The Face Of The Deep-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">With ears to hear and these eyes to see<br>
Night blanketed beneath our feet<br>
With arms embrace the chasm black<br>
Into the void hand in hand<br>
With finger tips feel the abyss<br>
Feel its emptiness<br>
Abandon breath from your chest<br>
Oblivion beckons us<br><br>

This life erase, eviscerate every trace<br>
Cast it out into the depths<br>
Shadows coiled in these crypts<br>
Push it all onto the brink<br>
Till all is one and all's extinct<br>
In this dark absence none can exist<br><br>

And away from this light we slip<br>
Inside this nothingness<br>
The one undone<br>
Into ether it lifts me<br>
These words in silent like this tomb<br>
This womb forever empty<br><br>

Feel it's cold to cheek benumb<br>
With lips we taste devoured sun<br>
Spiraling this flesh transcend<br>
Unraveling this temporal skin<br>
Like falling ash, let fall your face<br>
Finally our fall from grace<br>
Cast aside this body rotten<br>
We are all forgotten<br><br>

Obsidian now swallow world<br>
Inside the deepest pit were hurled<br>
We watch the death of every star<br>
Before our eyes<br>
This galaxy we will unstitch<br>
And through the gates and blackest pitch<br>
Onto the other side<br><br>

Opens wide<br>
Peer through the key hole<br>
And through lidless eye<br>
And to perceive infinite<br>
Dragon and serpent<br>
Dissonant instruments<br><br>

Trumpets herald signaling the end<br>
Exquisite music leading us into blacken<br>
Reborn from within this cavity<br>
Deaf and blind for all eternity<br><br>

Bringer of storms expel the light<br>
Shade you adorn<br>
Consume the sky and we'll marvel<br>
How we stole the sun<br>
Floating adrift, it is done<br>
Now all is one<br><br>

And from which it came<br>
It shall be again<br>
It stretches this endless goliath<br>
To wave after wave of the cold and the frost we are lost<br>
Submerged inside of this giant<br>
This titan in his fist he holds abyss<br>
And we are freed<br>
Without form and void we shall be<br><br>

In the furthest reaches<br>
Of this dimension these shadows which are hidden<br>
Enveloped by the gulf<br>
Hollow truly endless<br>
Dematerializing inside these whirlpools<br>
Into black hole condensing these molecules<br>
And be pulled by gravity into this vortex<br>
Reeling finally we stop and are suspended<br>
At the edge of all we stare into Dis<br>
Take my hand plunge from cliff<br><br>

With ears to hear and these eyes to see<br>
Night blanketed beneath our feet<br>
With arms embrace the chasm black<br>
Into the void hand in hand<br>
With finger tips feel the abyss<br>
Feel its emptiness<br>
Abandon breathe from your chest<br>
Oblivion beckons us<br><br>

This life erase, eviscerate every trace<br>
Cast it out into the depths<br>
Shadows coiled in these crypts<br>
Push it all onto the brink<br>
Till all is one and alls extinct<br>
In this dark absence none can exist</p>
