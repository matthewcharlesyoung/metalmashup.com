<br>
Get over yourself, they can see right through you<br>
We are the future like no one ever knew you<br>
Got the swag of a coward and the heart of a nemesis<br>
If you don't like these lyrics then go listen to Genesis<br>
Sega. We ain't playin' games, you took demise we'll take the fame<br>
<br>
And I can't wait to say whatever, and I can't wait to shed some light<br>
On every little thing you've broken, and get on with my life<br>
And I can't wait to be whoever, and I can't wait to speak my mind<br>
On every little thing you've broken, and get on with my life<br>
<br>
I heard from your friends that you've been stricken with fear<br>
Desperate for press in your pathetic career<br>
Can't get out of debt since your sales took a dive<br>
You can find out the hard way cowards never thrive<br>
<br>
If you'd cut records like cocaine you could still have a fucking name<br>
Yeah I guess I took it too far and I know<br>
the truth hurts but if you're scared bitch go to church<br>
<br>
And I can't wait to say whatever, and I can't wait to shed some light<br>
On every little thing you've broken, and get on with my life<br>
And I can't wait to be whoever, and I can't wait to speak my mind<br>
On every little thing you've broken, and get on with my life<br>
<br>
If they let you into heaven then I'd rather go to hell<br>
You think you're buying your way to the top with all that bullshit that you sell<br>
God's not naive like the fans you deceive.<br>
Even the devil was an angel what the fuck did he achieve?<br>
<br>
Wrath to the industry, and everything it used to be<br>
<br>
And I can't wait to say whatever, and I can't wait to shed some light<br>
On every little thing you've broken, and get on with my life<br>
And I can't wait to be whoever, and I can't wait to speak my mind<br>
On every little thing you've broken, and get on with my life<br>

What is a man, who can't take a stand for his daughter,<br>
and calls it tough love, tough love<br>
Your roots grow in the cracks of the alleys, college park made you<br>
Man enough to see, man enough to see, there ain't a goddamn man in me<br>

You've done it now, you planted a seed. Now the storm inside you–it swallows her<br>

Baby love, alright<br>
And I know life can be so strange<br>
But I know I can make a change<br>
I'mma wipe away the clouds for ya<br>

I'm gonna be around for ya,<br>
I'm gonna paint the town for ya,<br>
I'm gonna make a promise to give you everything you want and need,<br>
But she fucked up now, 'cause she's bearing another mouth you can't feed<br>
<br>
Cease production of a destructive breed,<br>
Seek help 'cause your pride only makes you weak<br>
<br>
And what is a man, who lays a hand on his lover,<br>
and calls it tough love, tough love<br>
What is a man, who can't take a stand for his daughter (can't take a stand),<br>
and calls it tough love, tough love<br>

So flip a coin for every shade of gray<br>
I bet you pick a needle to bargain with<br>
Heads I bet you fall asleep<br>
Get tangled in the sheets<br>
Suffocate as you choke at the though of your own dreams<br>
You never fail to feel hollow now hush and let the dark swallow<br>

Move a little closer, what are you afraid of?<br>
Set the night on fire, baby burn it up<br>
Tattooed on your chest, I.S.S.U.E.S<br>
Move a little closer, what are you afraid of? (What are you afraid of?)<br>

Zanies and panties on the floor<br>
To numb the pain<br>
Another one night stand at the door you go insane<br>

Lemme get my shit, lemme get in my whip, hit shift<br>
Then I'll drive to you<br>
Let me think a bit 'bout this<br>

Yet you are the only one who can see what I've done<br>

Laying here doesn't feel the same<br>
I need to get up and make a change<br>
Get up and get over this<br>
My voice it echoes my thoughts collide<br>
You said I'm dead to you I bled for you<br>
Now your dreams can come true<br>
There's a place in my bed where you rested your head<br>
Now I'm resting alone in this bed and it's cold<br>
I feel like a ghost, these memories go up in smoke<br>
You didn't want serious and It made me delirious<br>
2: 40 AM all I wrote was<br>

Yet you are the only one who can see what I've done<br>

This year's been lonely but at least it's through<br>
I'll write a letter to my former self<br>
Dear sad ghost, why'd you put your heart on the shelf<br>
<br>
You took the fun out of living<br>
When you took the life out of me<br>
<br>
Take a look into the mirror<br>
But you don't see yourself inside<br>
Watch it crack<br>
Your bad luck started with me<br>
And my good luck ended with you<br>

I know you're drunk again, and not thinking clear<br>
But when you write this down, at least try and sound<br>
A bit more sincere<br>

And I don't wanna be the person to slip up and hurt your feelings<br>
I guess they don't wanna say it to your face but I<br>
will cause somebody's gotta put you in your place<br>
I'm not afraid to scream and shout<br>
And f-f-f-freak out and throw my hands up<br>

Nah man, cause deep down you know it sucks to be you<br>

Making small stabs in passing<br>

Prescribe yourself with medication when you're feeling insecure<br>
I know the world is dark, but you've got the light<br>
Even sitting in the closet chilling with the skeletons you fight<br>
I guess you found the meaning of giving up on me<br>
I'm not the person that you thought I was<br>
I broke the ice I revealed the scandal<br>
But the water's deeper than you're able to handle<br>
Oh that's probably why you hit me twice<br>

What if I was wrong, and jumped to conclusions<br>
Cause the chance of losing you was all too dangerous<br>
So I just assume that you're doing things before you get the chance<br>
So I can leave and feel like I've got the upper hand<br>
Guilty yeah, maybe I'm just scared to go all in<br>
Never was much for the life of gambling<br>
But you can't win if you don't play<br>
If you don't play there's no shame in us<br>
Let's call a spade a spade<br>
<br>
I said I wouldn't let you down<br>
But it's like we both have changed somehow<br>
You've made a disease of this town<br>
And you act like you don't care but you left<br>
<br>
Your tears on the runway<br>
You think you're running away<br>
And you're leaving all your troubles behind<br>
But I'm not going with you this time<br>
I don't wanna try to pretend I'm somebody else<br>
Take me as I am or be left alone<br>
Tears on the runway, runaway<br>
You know that you love the chase<br>
Oh yeah, baby love<br>
With your tears on the runway<br>
<br>
This thing with us is flying south if you know what I mean<br>
But I'm trying my best to keep you right here in my city<br>
A wise woman said, I wish people weren't afraid of love<br>
Then she packed her shit and she ran<br>
Like a coward when the thunder struck<br>
<br>
Things aren't always picture perfect<br>
But picture us on top cause we're worth it<br>
Or go and get your ticket, and grab your sweater<br>
I used to live for the chase but now I know better<br>
<br>
Tears on the runway<br>
You think you're running away<br>
And you're leaving all your troubles behind<br>
But I'm not going with you this time<br>

As you divide my mind and force my years into minutes<br>
Destroy the hands of time, the hands that made me whole<br>

What if I become a silhouette of this very same thing<br>
Then everything you taught me seems to start fading<br>
Oh how am I now to survive as a heart divided<br>
Between the very hands that made me whole<br>

Did you even notice, all I wanted was more of your time<br>
Wasted on hating, when love's what should've made you blind<br>
Did you even notice, all I wanted was more of your time<br>

Before you give up because there's no trust<br>
At least you tried and that's just fine<br>
But how the hell do I know I'm not next in line<br>
It's not my fault, then why am I in the middle of this burning bridge<br>

Tell me oh how am I now to survive as a heart divided<br>

Can't do anything right<br>
And when midnight comes I've run out of time to<br>
Make some kind of difference<br>

Maybe I'm longing to change my own face<br>
To make you proud, I wanna make you proud<br>
When you're looking down on me<br>

I ask God questions and wonder why<br>

I wanna disappear with you now<br>

But I'm a selfish broken heart and how I got this far<br>
Coping with the thought of holding you<br>
a minute longer in my arms is beyond me<br>
I set you free, but I feel so guilty cause<br>
I take every sunrise for granted<br>
Sometimes I forget your voice I can't stand it<br>
Am I wrong for moving on<br>

Take wing over the coast of a better day<br>
I'm stuck in my dark days<br>
But I can be stronger than you remember<br>

I wanna see what you see<br>
I wanna be where you are<br>

Well I need you now<br>

You will be missed<br>

Living the lifestyle that we want<br>
Not a damn thing gonna change me<br>
I'll tell 'em where I'm from<br>
We're all young and dumb<br>
<br>
We were speeding with the top down<br>
Disturbing the peace like we ain't got none<br>
Our minds were stuck on getting older but we found out<br>
The music dies when you forget how to turn it up loud<br>
<br>
All we have is the good times<br>
And all we need is the moonlight<br>
Got the stars in our young eyes<br>
<br>
Living the dream, whoa<br>
Living the lifestyle that we want<br>
Not a damn thing gonna change me<br>
I'll tell 'em where I'm from<br>
We're all young and dumb<br>
<br>
Living the dream, whoa<br>
Living the lifestyle that we want<br>
Not a damn thing gonna change me<br>
I'll tell 'em where I'm from<br>
We're all young and dumb<br>

We're all young and dumb<br>
We're all young and dumb</p>

And no one’s there<br>
I feel thunder<br>
I won’t pretend you’re not<br>
Shaking up my world<br>

No I took you for granted<br>
But now I see<br>
So let me be the man I know I can be<br>
<br>
I’ve been changing<br>
Can’t believe how long that I’ve been waiting<br>
After every single dream has faded<br>
I can bring them back to you<br>
Hearts done breaking<br>
I promise I’m a risk worth taking<br>
This time it won’t be complicated<br>
Cause all I want is you<br>
We were made to last<br>
<br>
Do you ever ponder<br>
The sparks we had<br>
No explanation<br>
Just two madly in love wild cards<br>
Playing against the odds<br>
<br>
No I took you for granted<br>
But now I see<br>
So let me be the man I know I can be<br>

This time it won’t be complicated<br>
Cause all I want is you<br>
We were made to last<br>

I paid for all my mistakes<br>
And I know you suffered all I can say<br>
We were made to last<br>
Come back to me<br>

I’ve been changing<br>
Can’t believe how long that I’ve been waiting<br>

          <p class="lyrics-test-test">Once I was molded by the cruelest intentions<br>
I remember the days, I would justify all the speculation<br>
<br>
And if you’re gonna plant a rose expect some weeds to grow<br>
And if you ever get that far everyone's a critic of your every move<br>
I used to find time to be defined by the public eye<br>
Fuck it, I rose above it<br>
<br>
In a mental prison<br>
Searching for my big break<br>
I need less attention<br>
On all of my mistakes<br>
What if I gave it up<br>
And they’d stop trippin’<br>
All the doing dirt gone in a minute<br>
Just my luck<br>
It makes no difference<br>
Cause all the while I’m blind<br>
I’m doin’ fine<br>
<br>
I walked the walk and earned something<br>
If you quit the talk, you might fuckin’ learn something<br>
I grew up a fuckin’ screw up<br>
Got disrespect from the cliques<br>
All the kids I fuckin’ knew of<br>
I used to find time to be defined by the public eye<br>
Fuck it, I rose above it<br>

<br>
Success is a two way street, yeah<br>
But you never wanna meet halfway<br>
So we can share this victory<br>
When I said success I meant love<br>
Through all of the hate I must’ve forgot what it was<br>
Trying my best to be impartial to the bullshit<br>
But nowadays love is blind<br>
I’d like to think we doin’ fine<br>
<br>
I fell victim and I caved in to a flawed perspective<br>
Had it stuck in my mind, tried hard to cut the ties<br>
I fell victim to what<br>
I bet the whole world was concerned with<br>
You'll never know what it's like<br>
<br>
Unless I give it up<br>
And they stop trippin’<br>
All the doing dirt gone in a minute<br>
Just my luck<br>
It makes no difference<br>
Cause all the while I’m blind<br>
What if I gave it up<br>
And they’d stop bitchin’<br>
All the doing dirt gone in a minute<br>
Just my luck<br>
It makes no difference<br>
Cause all the while I’m blind<br>

Would give me nothing but bliss<br>

Say something I’m not giving up on you<br>
I’ll stay as long as I need to<br>

When I’m hurting just to know you’re fighting<br>
Listen to me reminiscing and let love guide you<br>

From the car to the ER<br>
Just think of me and pull yourself back to creation<br>

But I don’t get back what I give<br>

Your selfish got me feeling some type of way<br>

So correct me if I’m wrong<br>
Your life is a sad song<br>
Ravel couldn’t compose the mess God made on you<br>
Animalistic, material instinct<br>
Driving Jody’s Ferrari<br>
Tag chaser en route<br>

You treat me like I’m your little marionette<br>

Like where have you been lately<br>

You're wasting my time, and I don’t have much to fill it<br>
In the desert heat on my grind while you’re wasting my skrilla<br>
I’m out of sight, I’m out of mind, I’m paying your bills<br>
While you’re gold digging civilians just for the kill<br>

And you’ll just look the other way<br>

Got a hood rat and the alley cat heard<br>
The city got a kid hesitating to leave work<br>
At the right time in the wrong place got served<br>
An extendo not a miranda head first<br>

Get down, already knocked out face on the ground<br>
We’re at war with the ones who protect and serve<br>

Empty your clips on the victim<br>
And then you look the other way<br>
Minorities perish<br>
And even though he got his hands up<br>

Caged like animals<br>
Wound up and released with their badges<br>
Brutalize our streets, savages<br>
How many have to die<br>
To put an end to crooked swine<br>

And you just look the other way<br>
Empty your clips on the victim<br>
And then you look the other way<br>

Never showing up to my games<br>
Never taking us to arcades<br>
Seems like nothing has changed<br>

Nah, you don’t care about us<br>
