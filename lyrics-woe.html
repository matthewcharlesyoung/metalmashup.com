see all the trash I made.<br>
Stay a while, I'm on the verge of laying it down.<br>
A vagabond, and all his<br>
trash in search to find his crown.<br>
<br>
Your mind is like a candle stick,<br>
my ambitions are constantly burning out.<br>
<br>
I'd hate to, rain on your parade,<br>
But everything you know is taken by this flood,<br>
You were blind but there's no hope.<br>
Dig a hole but there's no blood,<br>
Who am I to pretend, who am<br>
I to recommend there is something less.<br>
Than timelines and whores that<br>
drag you back to the floor, and cut your eyes out.<br>
<br>
Find me, oh Saint, I'm bending,<br>
breaking, at my knees, praying.<br>
I've exposed, this earth has<br>
taken pride in seeing my,<br>
most vulnerable state.<br>
<br>
I find no humor in letting yourself stray away,<br>
from those pictures.<br>
When they cause you to see shame in yourself,<br>
you can run from your problems.<br>
But they'll follow you like a trend,<br>
One shot to forgetting,<br>
six shots to falling in the end.<br>
<br>
I was the king, of kings,<br>
I stand for one rule,<br>
and one rule for myself, as a man.<br>
I will fall and as my son you've watched it all.<br>
<br>
Behind every mask, lies a man,<br>
who can't live in his own skin.<br>
He lives by the flask,<br>
he bathes in his past, and he dies by his own sins.

And everybody says, you're just like me<br>
I begin to lift up my own flaws, to better you<br>

They say my head is my only prison,<br>
so I'll lock you up, I'll nail you down,<br>
I keep you safe, I'll keep you sound,<br>

with such a bitter plan, building all these scars<br>
Just go ahead, pull us out, to sea, relapse to what you were<br>
Such a commodity for you and me to be lost at sea,<br>
You drug me out here but honestly,<br>

These waves will take you farther, into the deep<br>

And I said, that this is the end, the end<br>
(Let's both be honest, this is the end)<br>
Pause, fold, contort, all your friends,<br>
They fell short and sold you out<br>

You're to far out, to swim you're way in,<br>

And your back will keep breaking,<br>
from this glass house, that you have created<br>
Hear me out, your heart is to heavy,<br>
to heavy for trust<br>
So build me a promise and take<br>
my advice a word from the wise<br>

You turned their whole world upside down<br>

But there’s just one small thing you forgot about<br>
That on the other side of heaven<br>
There’s always a hell<br>
And that’s one fucking place I know all too well<br>

So I’ll pick up a pen<br>

And you don't have the backbone that everyone believes you do<br>
So go ahead and talk your shit, I'll give you a reason to<br>
How does it feel to think so highly of yourself?<br>
<br>
And it's like they always say that the past will find you<br>
'cause karma is a bitch, it only comes back to remind you<br>
And after all of this time you will be put in your place<br>
I just hope that I'm around to see the look on your face<br>

'cause you see the one main difference between you and me<br>
Is that in this world where nothing comes for free<br>

But I'm the one who's standing tall.<br>
<br>
I'll give my all<br>
'Cause it's exactly where I'm supposed to be<br>
And not a single fucking one<br>
of you will take this from me.<br>
<br>
You can think whatever helps you sleep,<br>
But in reality it's obvious that you're in way too deep.<br>
This is exactly where I'm meant to be.<br>
There's not a chance in hell<br>
that you can take this from me!

        <h1 id="s9" class="lyrics-test">-I've Told You Once-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Get up!<br>
<br>
So hold these words up to your chest<br>
Prove to them all why you're the best<br>
And when they say you're just like the rest<br>
It's time to put that courage to the test<br>
<br>
So do your very best to tear them down<br>
until there's nothing left<br>
And while you're swelling on the past,<br>
we'll see who's laughing last<br>
<br>
You've said enough for both of us,<br>
so don't try to deny it<br>
And some things are better left unsaid,<br>
but I can't keep this quiet<br>
Well I'm not one to hold a<br>
grudge and hide it from the surface,<br>
'Cause every single thing<br>
I've ever held against you has a purpose<br>
You're good at starting problems for the hell of it,<br>
But our difference is that<br>
I don't use my past to make me feel relevant<br>
<br>
I've told you once and I'll tell you twice<br>
That everything comes with a price<br>
And after all the things you said,<br>
You should've known how this would end<br>
I've told you once and I'll tell you twice,<br>
That everything comes with a price<br>
Well you rolled the dice and now tough luck kid<br>
We're all pissed off, with no fucks to give<br>
<br>
'Cause you say that we're cowards<br>
and that we're the ones to blame,<br>
But we're one in a million<br>
and you're all the fucking same<br>
<br>
You're so proud of the one-liners you wrote<br>
It must be hard to talk shit with a dick in your throat!<br>
<br>
Let's take it back to the top,<br>
Whether you're ready or not<br>
You knew that we'd never stop,<br>
So bring the best that you got<br>
<br>
Maybe this is too much for you, whoa<br>
But how dare you even try to<br>
Take my words and turn them inside out<br>
To hide the fact that all your luck ran out<br>
Well who the hell gave you the right to<br>
Tell me how to live my life?<br>
And when you said enough is enough,<br>
I fought to keep going when the going get tough<br>
You might think you've got me tricked,<br>
But you're not hard to see through<br>
So let me make this clear,<br>
Don't bite the hand that feeds you

        <p class="lyrics-test-test">No one ever said that you had<br>
to face this on your own.<br>
Just do your best, forget the rest,<br>
you're stronger than you know;<br>
So let it all go.<br>
Don't dwell on all the things that you can't change,<br>
'Cause we are stronger,<br>
oh, we're so much stronger than we know.<br>
<br>
One by one you gave up hope and you<br>
prayed to God that I would choke,<br>
But I paid no mind to your attack<br>
because empty words can never hold me back.<br>
<br>
Every dream begins with a dreamer,<br>
We have a hope we must defend.<br>
No matter what, we'll come out swinging,<br>
We haven't reached the end.<br>
<br>
Every dream begins with a dreamer,<br>
We have a hope we must defend.<br>
No matter what, we'll come out swinging,<br>
We haven't reached the end.<br>
<br>
Just know you're not alone, we'll always be your home.<br>
So never give up hope and know you're not alone;<br>
And you don't have to face this on your own<br>
We said that we would live forever<br>
Well you laughed instead, you said we're dead.<br>
So get this through your head,<br>
I've got one more left.<br>
You better be ready to bring us your worst,<br>
This army is our family, oh,<br>
this is our family, and family comes first.<br>
<br>
Every dream begins with a dreamer,<br>
We have a hope we must defend.<br>
No matter what, we'll come out swinging.<br>

        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Did you honestly think for a<br>
second we played our final song?<br>
In spite of those who disagree,<br>
you know it feels damn good to prove you wrong!<br>
Singing oh whoa, we did it somehow<br>
And oh whoa, it’s our turn now<br>
We’ll shut you down<br>
you’ll drown like the rest of them<br>
Need I remind you?<br>
That you’re up against the best of them!<br>
<br>
So let me promise you this<br>
With ignorance as your bliss,<br>
your name won’t ever be missed<br>
when we are through with this<br>
I’ll be the thought that’s<br>
in the back of your head<br>
We’ll be the monsters hiding<br>
under your bed<br>
I’ll make you pay for all<br>
the things that you said<br>
Use your own line to cut<br>
off your fucking head!<br>
<br>
I thought I told you once<br>
that you reap what you sow<br>
But I guess this time around<br>
I’ll say I told you so<br>
Now that was clever<br>
But let me make this clear<br>
We are coming for you<br>
We are coming for you!<br>
<br>
Tell me why<br>
They painted us with guilt<br>
They said that we’re not good enough<br>
The only thing we’re<br>
guilty of is never giving up<br>
So take a second glance<br>
and put yourself into these shoes<br>
We got a second chance<br>
and we’ve got nothing left to lose<br>
So keep singing, oh whoa, whoa<br>
Oh whoa, whoa<br>
So keep singing!<br>
Take a second glance and<br>
put yourself into these shoes<br>
We got a second chance and<br>
we’ve got nothing left to lose</p>

You can never take this from me<br>

Your opinion means nothing<br>
Your words are shallow and<br>
you'll get what you deserve<br>

Isn't it funny how life works<br>
in such mysterious ways, mysteriously<br>
<br>
All my life,<br>
I've been waiting for<br>
this moment to live free and be me<br>
All my life,<br>
I have always fallen<br>
short but not this time<br>
All my life,<br>
I've been waiting for answer, all my life<br>
<br>
You couldn't stop me even if you wanted to<br>
It's plain to see, I wanna be<br>
A voice of hope<br>
Not the voice of a dying breed<br>
Finally I'm doing what I wanna do<br>
I've never felt so free in my whole life<br>
There's nothing I would trade for<br>
This is what I was made for<br>
<br>
I won't be held back by failure<br>
<br>
It's easy to lose yourself completely<br>
To become your own worst enemy<br>
Yeah, yeah<br>

Don't try to tell me how to live my life<br>
Don't try to justify what's wrong and what's right<br>

Lets put it this way<br>
I've been doing this for far too long<br>
To give up everything I've worked for<br>
I've made my deals and cut my losses<br>

For you it's all about the money<br>
For you it's all about the fame<br>
And how you play the game<br>

You couldn't stop me even if you wanted to<br>
It's plain to see, I wanna be<br>
A voice of hope<br>
Not the voice of a dying breed<br>
Finally I'm doing what I wanna do<br>
I've never felt so free in my whole life<br>
There's nothing I would trade for<br>
This is what I was made for<br>
<br>
Cause at the end of the day<br>
We're all just trying to make a way<br>
For ourselves<br>
<br>
And I'm giving everything<br>
that I have left inside of me<br>
Your words are meaningless<br>
Cause I'm above the negativity<br>
<br>
So take these words and hold them close<br>
It's not about where you are right now<br>

I ask myself what it is that's<br>
making me feel uneasy<br>
Why do I feel like this?<br>
I shouldn't be feeling like this<br>
<br>
Cause I am trying, I know you're<br>
lying when you say things are fine<br>
But we both knew what we were<br>
getting into, this happens every time<br>

These restless nights and hollow days<br>
You feel no need to change your ways<br>
And all this time, I failed to see<br>
The things that I had hoped for were never meant to be<br>

So what's it gonna take for us to figure all this out?<br>
Cause I've only got two weeks<br>
left here and right now my head is filled with doubt<br>
Don't take this time for granted,<br>
cause when I'm gone you'll wish you hadn't<br>
And appreciate this for what it is,<br>
cause pretty soon you're not gonna have it<br>

You feel no need to change your ways<br>
And all this time, I failed to see<br>
The things that I had hoped for were never meant to be<br>

You never know what you have until you lose it<br>
If this is what you really want,<br>
then now's your time to prove it,<br>
this is your time to prove it<br>
And all I wanna know is where did we go wrong<br>
Cause I'm sick to death of<br>
losing sleep and I'm sick of writing sad songs<br>

You feel no need to change your ways<br>

I'm not being fair<br>
Why don't you save all that for somebody who cares<br>

There's no way in hell that we can just be friends<br>

Before you go, I hope you know<br>
