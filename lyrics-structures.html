      <p class="lyrics-test-test">And if you thought it was over<br>
then you better think twice.<br>
You've been given your last chance, now face the fucking avalanche.<br>
<br>
And who the fuck are you to say that we're just wasting time?<br>
There's no need to look back as we approach the finish line.<br>
Can't stand side by side if you can't face the fucking avalanche.<br>
We're standing on top at last.<br>
<br>
At last, you'll have to face the fucking avalanche.<br>
Standing at the top of the world.<br>
At last, looking down from the top of the world.<br>
At last we feel alive.</p>

to live a separate way of life<br>
Some say it's our downfall<br>
But there are reasons why we tread on different sides<br>
And some say it's our downfall if we don't keep to the right<br>
Always keep gold in our sights<br>
Looking further into such things,<br>
there is no, there is no balance worth letting go<br>
<br>
We can tell that you're trying to swing at something you can't hit<br>
The wind won't blow you back on your feet when you're stuck on repeat<br>
So here, so here I stand,<br>
perfectly aligned with the,<br>
with the other side<br>
<br>
We can tell that you're trying to swing at something you can't hit<br>
It's all coming to a much needed end<br>
What the fuck's with all the shit that you've<br>
been force feeding down the throats of others<br>
Underneath the fucking covers, thinking that we wouldn't know<br>
<br>
Why do you try to live a worthless way of life?<br>
I've tried to explain to you a half a dozen times<br>
I've lied to you kindly half the time<br>
There is no reason to let ourselves go<br>
Pushing forward just to stay afloat<br>
Try to stay afloat<br>
<br>
We can tell that you're trying to swing at something you can't hit<br>
The wind won't blow you back on your feet when you're stuck on repeat<br>
Some say it's our downfall if we don't keep to the right<br>
We can tell that you're trying to swing at something you can't hit<br>
And it's coming to a much needed end<br>
<br>
And we'll never follow you because the road<br>
signs point us in the right direction<br>
Our sights will never align<br>
And we'll never follow you because the road<br>

And when the ground cracks beneath your feet,<br>
You will find the only thing that's left is peace of mind,<br>
Or any other fucking kind.<br>

I've been reciting this with an imminent gaze,<br>
And now I don't know if you've got it in you but,<br>
Life will be the fucking death of me.<br>
<br>
This is all just a repetition.<br>
To everyone, make it a mission to be the change you want to see.<br>
Lay down the foundation and where you wish to be.<br>
I promise that it won't be the place you'll find me.<br>
<br>
Get ready for the calm, before the storm.<br>
<br>
These are the words that we speak,<br>
But have you seen the things that we've been seeing?<br>
Buried beneath the walls, get ready for the calm I say.<br>
Have you seen what I've been,<br>
Waiting for the passage our light brings?<br>
Have you seen what I've seen?<br>
<br>
Get ready, buried beneath the walls.<br>
Today resigns the peace through our decisions.<br>
<br>
This is a calling to arms;<br>
We cannot face our decisions in favor of you.<br>
<br>
Don't you think it's time to go home?<br>
<br>
You're always running from it.<br>
This is what it feels to be torn,<br>
But death will beat you to it.<br>
Don't you think it's time to go home?<br>
This is what it feels to be torn and this is what it is.<br>

It's not like your stage is any higher, any louder<br>
You're still only 10 feet above flat ground<br>
Hell, I don't want to, but I'll give it to you<br>
<br>
Every face down there wants you<br>
Although, they'll turn at the drop of a dime<br>
Like wild dogs we're all waiting in line<br>
For you to fuck up hard enough, so we can push you aside<br>
<br>
We've learned there's more to music than sound<br>
And if you're listening, I hope you know we built this up from the ground<br>
Every remark with heart<br>
We're not saints, but at least we're not fake<br>
<br>
And if you're listening, then put your hands up in the air and sing:<br>
We're not afraid to finally speak our minds<br>
We're not afraid and we're no longer blind<br>
We're not afraid to leave your bullshit scene behind<br>
We're not afraid, we're not afraid this time, oh!<br>
<br>
Train wrecks develop so slowly<br>
And in due time this life will fill your heart with hate<br>
In due time, life will reject your advances<br>
We'll attempt to put the world on its axis, oh!<br>
<br>
We don't know who you are right now<br>
Hey now, this ain't about you<br>
But everything relies on first impressions<br>
So when the most we know was just<br>
your shitty town and your shitty friends<br>
To simplify it, you're so irrelevant<br>
<br>
I'll say you're not worth shit, although the world's a market for it<br>
I just hope they see the problem with this<br>
I'll bite my tongue, this system is corrupt<br>
So we'll just shake it off, and continue being underdogs<br>
<br>
You're all so god damn easily impressed<br>
We don't know who you are right now<br>
Hey now, this ain't about you<br>
But everything relies on first impressions<br>
<br>
So when the most we know was just your bad tattoos, trends<br>
And underdeveloped pen stains you scribble to shit friends<br>
I'll say you're not worth shit, although the world's a market for it<br>
I hope that they see the problem</p>

Now breathe in the masses, a carrier in our feat of tired dreams.<br>

Gravity holds us to a stand still.<br>
Look for the better signs;<br>
We're all in pursuit of this time.<br>
<br>
It's all laid out right in front of me,<br>
Looking back into absence.<br>
And I'll stop running from what never chases me,<br>
When you keep your hands where everyone can see.<br>
<br>
What's become of this place we once loved?<br>
They said it was coming.<br>
Oh fuck, this is just my luck.<br>
<br>
We've all paid the fucking price.<br>
They said it was coming,<br>
Oh my god, now here it comes.<br>

Tides never brought the change we all thought that they would bring.<br>
Now set the sky aflame.<br>

So tell me, are you gonna make a decision<br>
that you'll regret years from now?<br>

When you keep your hands where everyone can see<br>
But what's become of this place we once loved.<br>
You can back into absence.<br>

So bite your fucking tongue,<br>

Keep that in mind when you're running circles left and right.<br>
<br>
God damn everyone in this place, because I hate everything.<br>
I've been face-to-face with the times.<br>
Good luck to everyone in this fucking place,<br>
And god damn everyone in this fucked up place.<br>
God damn everyone in this place, because I hate everything.<br>

I've been dying to hear your thoughts on our infatuation with sound.<br>
If you see it as a burden then sit the fuck down.<br>
<br>
So set the stopwatch to the beat of your dead heart,<br>
And watch us run right past you.<br>
You know we'll outlast you, because we're always fucking first place.<br>
Well you might as well spit in my fucking face.<br>
It's insulting enough you couldn't trust us.<br>
You still stutter when we're face to face or alone.<br>
We're always fucking first place.<br>
How does it feel to stare at each falling grain of sand?<br>
How does it feel to count them down all by yourself?<br>
We tried to reset the clocks, so you can fuck yourself.</p>

      <p class="lyrics-test-test">When I awoke in a pool of sweat<br>
Not a thought crossed my mind that I was reading the wrong signs<br>
This all so meaningless to me,<br>
and as endless as it seems<br>
I've been turning the other cheek to<br>
the thoughts that left me feeling weak<br>
Every time this happens to me,<br>
I find more than good reason in speaking slowly<br>
Yet I refuse to believe that the truth is a life<br>
I'm at fault for the decisions I have made<br>
<br>
I'm falling asleep<br>
I swear I've seen this a thousand times before<br>
It's like a metaphor that I can't ignore, anymore<br>
This is the last time I remember crawling on my knees in desperation<br>
I'm falling asleep again<br>
<br>
Why can't I wake up? Time to wake up<br>
Pretend everything's fine<br>
Relapse, one more fucking time<br>
<br>
The grass is greener on the other side<br>
All the time spent backpedaling seems useless<br>
Because you never really get back what you've lost<br>
But I've spent my life at the edge of the clouds<br>
Obsessed with the sound, I'll never look down<br>
<br>
Why can't I wake up? Time to wake up<br>
Pretend, everything's fine<br>
Relapse<br>
<br>
Dear dreamer, did you ever think to cover your tracks?<br>
Keep light on the footsteps<br>
'Cause if the shoe fits, well the fucking shoe fits<br>
Come to peace with it and you'll breathe<br>
Sanity, it never Seems to come easily to me<br>
<br>
Dear dreamer, it's not my fault your life's a fucking nightmare<br>
It'll slip right through your hands<br>
Dear dreamer, it's time you rub your eyes and look at your sad reality</p>

      <h1 id="f8" class="lyrics-test">-Tunnel Vision-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">Day one: picked apart myself<br>
Lost in translation, I've stumbled on the misfortunes of life<br>
We are the fallen<br>
We are the fractured skies<br>
We are the living nightmare and we can't open our eyes<br>
<br>
So clap your hands to the beat of the drum<br>
If you think that some days never end<br>
Give in, understand this:<br>
If we're the only living thing in the world<br>
Your narrow mind can't wage war on what's left now, looking away<br>
So careless, and self taught, not selfless<br>
<br>
"Explain"<br>
What?<br>
"Your thought process"<br>
I shouldn't listen to this!<br>
"When did you become so arrogant?"<br>
It's my choice for once<br>
<br>
Inhale the words you never thought you could handle<br>
Cold hands won't hold open the door for your eyes<br>
And tell you you're missing a substance<br>
In fact it's the only thing crossing your mind<br>
You're fucked in the head<br>
We're all fucked in the end<br>
<br>
Day two: read over my notes<br>
I packed a map to skip the fault lines in the road<br>
But when it ends, I've still got nowhere to go<br>
We are the fallen<br>
We are the fractured skies<br>
We are the living nightmare and we can't open our eyes<br>

We're not the only living thing in the world<br>
Open your eyes</p>

      <p class="lyrics-test-test">Lately, I've been focused so plainly<br>
on the process of moving forward<br>
How life was never easy, how we're alone through it<br>
Just like how we're alone and<br>
<br>
This time we spend retreating back to our heads<br>
For the greater good we were broken down<br>
If you only have a few words make them count<br>
I know that it's hard to grasp, but I won't let go<br>
<br>
We've learned our role in the earth's tilt<br>
We try to find some meaning left in sound<br>
They say that home is where you make it<br>
But home's a sad story when you're always alone<br>
<br>
I'm not your fucking shoulder to cry on<br>
I'm not the one you fucking rely on<br>
It's so sad you'll die alone<br>
<br>
I can see how the past holds meaning<br>
But it's still out of reach and that's a simple fact<br>
Second guessing yourself has never come so easily<br>
<br>
It's not worth it, move forward this time<br>
It's not worth it<br>
<br>
Lately, I've found my lungs to be heavy<br>
Stopping me from moving forward<br>
They never said it was easy<br>
I hear them now<br>
<br>
It's like we're all alone in this<br>
time we spend retreating back to our heads<br>
It's all useless if we can't make<br>
you see some sort of meaning<br>
This was always our intent<br>
<br>
Can you hear us now?<br>
This was always our intention<br>
For the greater good we're all broken down, in one way or another<br>
(Can you hear us now?)<br>
And to those who weren't... well I'll wish you were<br>
<br>
It's so hard, yet so important, not to live so securely<br>
Loss finds nothing but meaning<br>
Lately, I've been focused so plainly<br>
Lately, it's hard to keep believing<br>
But maybe we're not alone in it and maybe<br>
we weren't broken down in the first place</p>

But the view gets worse without the ties that keep one sane<br>
(Just a few days drive away)<br>
And if they back out now<br>

It's amazing how much people change<br>
You can think what you want, but we're always gonna be the same<br>
(We'll never apologize, 'cause you were never on our side)<br>
<br>
How can you all look at me the same way?<br>
It's safe to say<br>
Your hearts are in the wrong place<br>
Let's be honest, 'cause honestly<br>
Not everything is so damn hard to believe<br>
So stop talking - your words just get in the way<br>
Your hearts are in the wrong place<br>
<br>
(Trust me when I say)<br>
We don't miss the constant bullshit you left at our doorstep<br>
Or the lack of scenery<br>
I guess life built us differently<br>
<br>
How can you all look at me the same way?<br>
How can you all look at me the same way?<br>
Your hearts are in the wrong place<br>
<br>
So while wandering through the labyrinth in my head<br>
I found peace of mind in giving up on all the ones who left<br>
And we won't miss the arguments<br>
We won't miss the constant stress<br>
And we won't miss the constant bullshit you left at a doorstep<br>
<br>
We're the ones you love to hate<br>
We're the ones who stay awake and treat themselves so commonly<br>
To the smoke and the scenery<br>
(And you'll never escape, you'll never escape)<br>
Burning bridges, digging your own grave<br>
(And you'll never escape, you'll never escape)<br>
Your hearts are in the wrong place<br>
<br>
Shut up<br>
We still don't give a fuck<br>
No one ever did<br>
We've grown so sick of it<br>
What have you done with your life?<br>
Still can't contend with this<br>
Good luck champ; go break a fucking leg<br>
Good luck champ; go break a fucking leg</p>

        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Let's hear it for regret<br>
It sticks in my mind like a secret, and it's caused so much pain<br>
So let me explain why I've been drinking my conscience<br>
Under the table<br>
Swimming with scapegoats<br>
I'm clearly unstable<br>
There's nothing for me<br>
So I will carry the weight of all my past mistakes<br>
Until I'm blue in the fucking face<br>
It started storming when I left the heart that I was warming<br>
It never just rains - it's always pouring<br>
<br>
So listen up, I've too much pride to lay down and die<br>
But I never got a chance to say goodbye<br>
<br>
Let's hear it for regret<br>
It sticks in my mind like a secret, and it's caused so much pain<br>
So let me explain why I've been drinking my conscience<br>
Under the table<br>
I'm clearly unstable<br>
Carry the weight of your past mistakes<br>
Until you're blue in the face from every step that you take<br>
<br>
Tear me apart<br>
This guilt is so frustrating<br>
Tear me apart<br>
Rewind to the start and<br>
Tear me apart<br>
I wish I could say goodbye<br>
<br>
I never got a chance to say goodbye<br>
So when you feel like you've losing in the long run<br>
I'll be standing right beside you with a shotgun<br>
Boom<br>
I will never come to terms with leaving, so take me home<br>
<br>
I've got too much pride to lay down and die<br>
We've been failing, every breath that we take<br>
We've been failing, every step that we take<br>
<br>
Tear me apart<br>
This guilt is so frustrating<br>
Tear me apart<br>
Rewind to the start and<br>
Tear me apart<br>
I wish I could say goodbye<br>
<br>
Pray for the shores<br>
The tides are changing<br>
The waters are raising too high for my head to keep above<br>
The difference was<br>
I still made it out<br>
<br>
My conscience has some questions to ask<br>
(So call back)<br>
They've been piling since the day that you left<br>
(So come back)<br>
I've got a couple questions to ask but there's no one<br>
(No one)<br>
To answer me back<br>
I've got a couple questions to ask<br>
(So come back)<br>
My conscience has some questions to ask<br>
(So call back)</p>

        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Gone with the wind<br>
You came unseen and left unheard<br>
Deception hides in the face of the breed you created<br>
The mess that you made<br>
Will surely be swept off you feet and underneath the carpet of our eyes<br>
But enough is enough<br>
With your lies<br>
<br>
Because I'm young and I'm pissed off at the way you let the world run<br>
Paid my prescription and then I hear that you gave it way to someone<br>
Who is truly not in need<br>
I'll bite off the hand that feeds us shit<br>
<br>
The mouth of the greedy and innocent<br>
Would both go hand in hand<br>
But one hand is missing<br>
And the other one's kissing the asses of Americans<br>
"Land of the free"<br>
And home of the liars, deceit and Jesus Christ<br>
I thought I heard you crying in the night<br>
'Cause no one buys that shit you disguise as gold<br>
The lies you told are growing thing with the world<br>
They all sound the same<br>
You promised a change<br>
So clean up the mess that you've made<br>
<br>
I will never see eye to eye with you<br>
I will always see eye to eye with you<br>
(With you)<br>
You should call yourself a liar<br>
'Cause all that you know are the fables you're fed<br>
I will never see eye to eye with you<br>
I will always see eye to eye with you<br>
(With you)<br>
<br>
Save your sorry breath<br>
We're books on a shelf<br>
Coated in wealth<br>
The letters we're filled with are dressed in shit<br>
Paper in plastic wrap<br>
All we are is paper in plastic on a shelf<br>
Wrapped in golden lies<br>
<br>
You came unseen and left unheard<br>
Deception hides in the face of the breed you created<br>
The mess that you made<br>
Will surely be swept off you feet and underneath the carpet of our eyes<br>
But enough is enough<br>
With your lies<br>
All you know is a broken telephone<br>
All you know is a broken telephone</p>

        <p class="lyrics-test-test">There's a hole in the center of Earth<br>
Where the rest of the world sinks, but I stand still<br>
I never wanted to make a decision<br>
We live like fish in a salt water prison<br>
<br>
Hey! Hey!<br>
When the iron sinks I will swim instead<br>
<br>
Why are you waiting for the sky to have its fun?<br>
The clouds don't always block the sun<br>
Don't wait for the world to slip away<br>
Don't wait for the world to slip away<br>
<br>
I've been standing on top of a thought that exists<br>
Withholding the pain 'til it's sent to my wrist<br>
As every day grows older, another weight adds to my shoulders<br>
<br>
Hey! Hey!<br>
When the iron sinks I will swim instead<br>
Hey! Hey!<br>
Take another look inside your head<br>
<br>
So who's the one with the mask on?<br>
Cover your face at the thought of rejection<br>
You, you are the one with the mask on<br>
Find your fate before it's too late<br>
<br>
Why are you waiting for the sky to have its fun?<br>
The clouds don't always block the sun<br>
Don't wait for the world to slip away<br>
And now I'm staring at the clouds<br>
Let the rain pour down and soak this stable ground<br>
As long as life allows, I'll continue not to make a sound<br>
<br>
Get off your feet and fucking move<br>
So who's the one with the mask on?<br>
Cover your face at the thought of rejection<br>
You, you are the one with the mask on<br>
Find your fate before it's too late<br>
Get off your feet and fucking move</p>

I walked right into this<br>
Hands up with no witness<br>

I stood willing to make you fit<br>
And I swear you did<br>
I tried doing my best to squeeze this heart from my chest<br>
And now we're stuck with the rest of this distance, in every instance<br>
<br>
It's time to reap what you have sown<br>
Because you know, you know you're growing old<br>

No one wants to die alone<br>
I'm bitter at my best, as hopeless as it gets<br>
Dilute your stress with the bullshit<br>

No, you don't see<br>

All my love will swallow me, and all my hate will be the death<br>

You're ice cold, and no one wants to die alone<br>

I miss the sound of your feet on the floor<br>
I wish that I could see your face, and not your ghost, once more
<br>
Everyone is stained<br>
With some degree of endless pain<br>
We're all alone in our own ways<br>
Excluded at our own pace<br>
Growing restless to relate<br>
With a constant, stable substrate<br>
<br>
Who the fuck am I supposed to come home to?<br>
Like motivation for a lost cause<br>
We're growing further and further from the first thought<br>
It's aggravating (fuck) for the most of us<br>
When life lets us settle with the dust<br>
<br>
I feel lost<br>
Without you alive I've been spiraling down every fucking night<br>
You're what healed me<br>
You're saved me from myself<br>

So who the fuck am I supposed to come home to?<br>
When all the colors fade to blue<br>

I will justify my weakened strength with a classic hate<br>
I will justify my weakened strength with a classic hate<br>
It pains me to bury all the things that relate to me<br>
To lose the only one who put faith in me<br>
To let the world take what was meant for me<br>
And I swear you were meant for me<br>
<br>
Lost<br>
Without you alive I've been spiraling down every fucking night<br>
I feel lost<br>
Without you alive I've been spiraling down<br>
I wish you could catch me now<br>

I evolved by mistake<br>

Pull these words from my throat<br>

Dwell and sink deeper<br>
While the picture gets bigger and bigger<br>

Until we see the world from a different perspective<br>
Better perspectives are greeted with lessons of easing the stress<br>
Giving rest to the restless<br>

Ignorance is only bliss if you don't give a shit about it<br>

Forget what was said<br>
I'm losing control of my body and soul, and my head is drifting away<br>
As black fades to red, a voice calls out to me<br>

You like the taste of fire burning through like cancer?"<br>
Whatever you desire... acquire it"<br>
We're all capable of being what we want to<br>
So which side are you on?<br>
You tread so lightly on a line in the sand and if<br>
you can't decide then you're already gone<br>
<br>
I am the cure<br>
Where in this moment<br>
All your dreams are certainties<br>
What you say is so discerning I just wish I was dead<br>
But I'll never experience the emotion that<br>
comes with a separation from the head<br>
To the spirit of the body<br>

I can't speak<br>
I can't breathe<br>

My mind is an ocean waiting for the calm before this storm<br>
"You wanna do it again?<br>
You like the taste of fire burning through like cancer?<br>
What ever you desire... acquire it"<br>

It shouldn't appear in my veins<br>
Yet it remains my ally in self-decay<br>

Four walls will keep us secure<br>
Year after year<br>
<br>
Afraid of the world we all pose like children<br>
Suspicion won't kill them<br>
Let's lay our heads atop of the bed,<br>
'cause I'm sick of the way we're living<br>
I can't believe that we still deceive this looking glass as vision<br>
There is always a safe haven at home<br>
Best case scenario we'll still be miserable<br>

Bury me below<br>
My mind's a ticking time bomb so I'll bury it below<br>
My eyes are tired of glaring through lifeless windows<br>
Your future's at risk unless you open the door<br>
Disclose the contents of your heart on the floor<br>

I can never regret you<br>
I would never forget this floor<br>
I can never forget all the times we've spent indoors<br>
<br>
At least we were safe in there<br>
Away from the worries and the cares<br>
At least we were safe in there<br>
Diverse from the rest of the Earth<br>
At the seams we tear<br>
The reason I've been living a lie<br>
Is I would rather stare at life outside a window than die<br>

So tear away from the dotted line where you slept so close to me<br>
