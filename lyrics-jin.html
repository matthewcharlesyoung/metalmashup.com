Hardly had I opened my eyes I joined their ranks:<br>
Colors are faded away, sounds suspend in delay.<br>
Hey, mother, tell me<br>
Where is my home?!<br>
<br>
I don't belong to this race,<br>
Nor to this planet,<br>
Nor to this galaxy!<br>
Here bottomless greed dances with<br>
Eternal stupidity!<br>
<br>
They upgrade, they descend every hour.<br>
A mother gives birth to her child to self-devour.<br>
Any beat of life, a sparkle of spirit they seem to hate.<br>
As soon as beauty is born<br>
They discriminate!<br>
<br>
And no respect to their race,<br>
Nor to this planet,<br>
Nor to this galaxy!<br>
And no desire to uproot their greed<br>
And eternal stupidity<br>
<br>
And invincible ignorance!<br>
Intolerable arrogance<br>
<br>
Am I floating down the river of insanity<br>
Or becoming just another part of you?<br>
I'll return, I'll come home where they wait for me,<br>
Where the nature reins the life but not you.<br>
<br>
This time we trade our lives<br>
To experience the brand new world,<br>
To realize how wrong we've been all these years,<br>
How many wonders we could behold.<br>
<br>
Am I floating down the river of insanity<br>
Or becoming just another part of you?<br>
I'll return, I'll come home where they wait for me,<br>
Where the nature reins the life but not you.</p>

Childhood begins with conversion<br>
Young scions are given no will<br>
Their roots set deep in perversion<br>
Of truth from this false beacon hill</p>

        <h1 id="s8" class="lyrics-test">-Dip A Sail-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Your boat is called Apocalypse<br>
Dip a sail<br>
Those who regulate the head<br>
Bite their tail, bite their tail<br>
Maps are lost in hurricane of regress<br>
Your clothes are frazzled, still you navigate<br>
With having your crew oppressed<br>
<br>
Pour some wine into your throat<br>
Stuff your guts a little more<br>
While your avarice accumulates<br>
The poor multiply hundredfold<br>
<br>
Your ship is called Capitalism<br>
Anchor down<br>
It runs for dear life on the wind of corruption<br>
Defective compass serves to your purpose<br>
But soon as sweat of sailors dries<br>
You'll hit the bottom and go ashore<br>
<br>
Pour some wine into your throat<br>
Stuff your guts a little more<br>
While your avarice accumulates<br>
The poor multiply hundredfold<br>
<br>
Make these oars never row<br>
Dip a sail<br>
Strike the masts, end the boat<br>
To the sand<br>
Make these oars never row<br>
Dip a sail<br>
Strike the masts, end the boat<br>
To the sand</p>

        <h1 id="s9" class="lyrics-test">-Pisces-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Step forward and meet a new sunrise<br>
A coward is shivering inside<br>
Today I'll be a friend of mine<br>
Who swallows suffering with smile<br>
I drew a different reality<br>
With unconditional loyalty<br>
Ego hardly can be piqued<br>
'Cause I'm selfless<br>
<br>
Scale armour belies<br>
Virgin innocence<br>
One being brings life<br>
Another runs for death<br>
Scale armour belies<br>
Virgin innocence<br>
One being brings life<br>
Another runs for death<br>
<br>
No promises I ever give<br>
Don't rely on me and I won't deceive<br>
The beginning or the end you can't tell<br>
When I wave my fin and shake my tail<br>
I grew in different normality<br>
With unblamable morality<br>
Hooks and nets are there for me<br>
But I'm skittish<br>
<br>
Scale armour belies<br>
Virgin innocence<br>
One being brings life<br>
Another runs for death<br>
Scale armour belies<br>
Virgin innocence<br>
One being brings life<br>
Another runs for death<br>
<br>
Neptune's child shivering inside<br>
Drowns in the liquid gold<br>
Cherished his life to the underworld<br>
Meet me flashing when winter cries<br>
<br>
Pisces swimming through the river<br>
All their life against the stream<br>
Searching for a hook to catch on and see their sun beam<br>
Then suffocate in painful tortures<br>
On cutting tables of callous men<br>
Under a knife of handsome butchers<br>
Emeralds are ripped away<br>
Emeralds are ripped away<br>
Emeralds are ripped away<br>
Emeralds are ripped away
</p>

        <h1 id="s10" class="lyrics-test">-Beggar's Dance-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">We do what we have been trained to<br>
Hopeless beggars, dance to this beatific flute<br>
If there's a Lord out there, he's just a guest<br>
Under this dome of ignorance<br>
Our boat is called Apocalypse<br>
Who's in front of us we cut them deep<br>
Yet untold, still unheard<br>
We cherished lives to the underworld<br>
<br>
King of everything<br>
King of everything<br>
King of everything<br>
Who's your king of everything?<br>
King of everything<br>
King of everything<br>
King of everything<br>
Who's your king of everything?<br>
<br>
Who's your king of everything?<br>
Oh, king, king of everything, yeah<br>
<br>
King of everything<br>
Hopeless beggars, dance to this beatific flute<br>
Oh</p>
