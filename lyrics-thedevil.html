I'd like every backbiter to know that audience is always priority, rather than the stage<br>
It all comes down to this<br>
Look elsewhere for books of narcissism<br>
Pride is a trend that is far past swollen<br>
Death through windows<br>
No longer can I live a life of no control<br>
These stories we've been writing are water-thin<br>
It's disheartening because I know that we are capable of vision<br>
Blemishes are warnings so simply concentrate and apply pressure<br>
And it's branches will be broken<br><br>
The city to be punished<br>
So many never listen<br>
And I drown in disgust<br>
When you will you ever remember?<br>
When will you realize (that) false statements fall to the feet of dead Gods?<br>
False statements fall to the feet of dead Gods!</p>

                <p class="lyrics-test-test">For the first time in three years,<br>
official clocks will pause for Earth's rotation to realign with atomic time.<br>
Fluctuation is due to Earth's interaction with the Moon:<br>
primarily tidal acceleration.<br>
This proess, this effect of tidal force,<br>
slows our planet's rotation.<br><br>
Angular momentum, in direct correspondence<br>
with Earth's axial tilt is dampened.<br>
An existing kinetic energy within orbit is lessened.<br>
All the same, the reduction is notably fractional:<br>
specifically, days on Earth grow 1.4 milliseconds longer every one hundred years.<br>
To put that in a different perspective,<br>
it won't be for another 100,000 years until each day is<br>
about one and a half seconds longer than as they exist today.</p>
