Never draw<br>

Wherever I go,<br>
I don't want to go.<br>
Without you<br>
Without you<br>
<br>
A feeling I can't help but chase<br>
It seems somehow I've lost my place<br>
I was gone<br>
Too long<br>
Now I've been erased<br>
Not even I<br>
Recognize my face<br>
Not even I<br>
Recognize my face.<br>
<br>
All these places are never the same.<br>
I can't believe I've grown so deranged<br>
You haunt me anyway I run,<br>
I'll never change<br>
Into what you've become<br>

Wherever I go,<br>
I don't want to go.<br>
Without you

          <p class="lyrics-test-test">I never knew<br>
You were more than a voice that made its home inside my head<br>
Now I'm carving scars into my arms<br>
To remember what it feels like to feel anything.<br>
<br>
That was only the start<br>
My addiction to tearing myself apart<br>
I'm in love with hating myself<br>
Its the only real thing I've ever felt<br>
<br>
I hold a gun to the head of God<br>
Please tell me where i went wrong<br>
Every single step I take<br>
Leads me right back to the same mistakes<br>
I've been here before<br>
But i adore the pain keep coming back for more.<br>
<br>
I bleed just to see<br>
If there's anything left inside of me<br>
We are a perfect fit<br>
A sadist and a masochist<br>
<br>
I've never been good enough<br>
<br>
I am never good enough.</p>

          <p class="lyrics-test-test">I keep seeing<br>
The same things<br>
Over and over and over again<br>
I will never understand,<br>
How the lowest people always get the upper hand<br>
<br>
And as time ticks by<br>
I sit and wonder why..<br>
I ever gave a fuck about anything<br>
Watch me fall asleep<br>
Neck deep<br>
Hanging straight down,<br>
Tied up<br>
...to the fucking ceiling<br>
<br>
My pigmentation is turning black<br>
Now I know that I'll never be turning back<br>
In this world..<br>
Where hell means home<br>
I will come up,<br>
From the bottom<br>
Through sticks<br>
And stones<br>
<br>
It's all your fault<br>
I've become so hollow<br>
An apparition<br>
Of my own ghost<br>
I wont ever<br>
Crawl down to your level<br>
I'd rather<br>
Rot in limbo<br>
<br>
Sit here,<br>
And play this game<br>
Let's skip the introduction<br>
And say no names<br>
My own..<br>
Is my own<br>
In rooms of thousands<br>
I still stand alone<br>
<br>
Why am I<br>
The only one<br>
With eyes as empty as the ocean<br>
ㅤ<br>
I knew I should have known<br>
I wish I never let you see what I've shown<br>
I've lost<br>
All<br>
Hope<br>
I was born to<br>
Be alone<br>
I knew I should have known<br>
I wish I never let you see what I've shown<br>
I've lost<br>
All<br>
Hope<br>
I was born to<br>
Be alone

          <p class="lyrics-test-test">I know I'm a failure in your fucking eyes<br>
But it doesn't matter to me cause you're fucking blind<br>
My entire life has been a waste of time<br>
Falling for the same tricks in a different disguise<br>
<br>
This is my shadow self<br>
Ever since I can remember you look out for yourself<br>
I must be dreaming<br>
Because for once it seems I'm seeing clearly<br>
<br>
Did you think that you could just leave me here to die<br>
I don't know what I did to deserve this<br>
You don't even treat me like a fucking person<br>
<br>
I have no heart<br>
I have no fucking heart<br>
Everything I touch always falls apart<br>
Why fight for something that's not meant to be<br>
I'm done being treated like the dirt underneath your feet<br>
<br>
Fill my eyes with flies and cut my throat so I can't breathe<br>
I'm so sick of the tangled web we weave<br>
I'd give anything to rid me of these memories<br>
<br>
THIS IS MY SHADOW SELF!</p>

          <p class="lyrics-test-test">How could i have stole your spirit<br>
You don't even have a soul<br>
<br>
Lost in an empty vessel<br>
<br>
Claiming connection with self<br>
But your being is artificial<br>
<br>
How does it feel to be so hollow?<br>
<br>
Tongue tied by a language of lies<br>
<br>
Drop the God complex<br>
You are no better than the rest of us<br>
Come back to the fucking slums<br>
<br>
Something so small can spiral out of control<br>
Before you even notice<br>
It becomes your whole world<br>
What am I to do?<br>
I've lost my path<br>
I never thought to<br>
<br>
Fear the after math<br>
<br>
Come back to the bottom<br>
You forgot where you've come from.

I wouldn't think twice<br>
I would take the step<br>
Right over the edge<br>
<br>
Eternally I have wondered why<br>
As all of the days go by<br>
I'm always the one who's left behind<br>
I'm always the one who gets left behind!<br>
<br>
I can see you forgot about me<br>
I'm nothing more than a memory<br>
The ghost of half the man i used to be<br>
<br>
We fell apart in perfect symmetry<br>
We fell apart in perfect symmetry<br>
<br>
Am I nothing<br>
More than a figment of my own imagination<br>
Never ending<br>
Thought left circling in contemplation<br>
A wandering soul without any destination<br>
Am..I..Despair?<br>
<br>
I've developed infatuations<br>
Intertwined by hallucinations<br>
They have become my only inspiration<br>
I realize life's foundation<br>
Has become manipulation<br>
No one..really...cares!<br>
<br>
A moment i have waited for<br>
With such anticipation<br>
Ill exhale my last breath<br>
With no sense of hesitation<br>
<br>
My aura has lost all of its illumination<br>
If you wish to vanish<br>
Follow my demonstration<br>
<br>
I can show you how to disappear<br>
I can show you how to disappear<br>
<br>
I am nothing<br>
More than a figment of my own imagination<br>
Never ending<br>
Thought left circling in contemplation<br>
A wandering soul without any destination<br>
I am despair<br>
<br>
I am nothing<br>
<br>
I am despair</p>

<br>
We are nothing but illusions<br>
Lost inside our own delusions<br>
We're victims of our own seclusion<br>
<br>
It's all inside of my head!<br>
<br>
Almost like déjà vu<br>
All of my dreams in the hue of blue<br>
Believing all the lies I wish were true<br>
<br>
I know we've made choices<br>
We wish we didn't choose<br>
But you will always have me<br>
Even when I don't have you<br>
<br>
You are the sun, and I am your moon<br>
I am your artist; you are my muse<br>
<br>
I've been lost<br>
Inside of dreams I see with open eyes<br>
I've grown fond of<br>
The bliss from this eclipse between body and mind<br>
<br>
Hollow bodied entity<br>
Won't you walk with me<br>
Show me something that I've never seen<br>
I've lost the line between reality and my dreams<br>
<br>
Something so shallow<br>
Can sink so low<br>
<br>
You are the sun, and I am your moon<br>
I am your artist; you are my muse<br>
<br>
You will always have me...<br>
Even when I don't have you....

Dreamless and sleepless<br>
Counting the stars<br>
Just to watch them fall<br>
Prisoner of phobia<br>
Afraid of my shadow<br>

<br>
I still remember the way<br>
You used to say my name<br>
As if I were your own<br>
As if this ever meant<br>
Anything at all<br>

I'd give anything to go back to that moment<br>
Even if only for a moment<br>
<br>
How can I forget<br>
The only things that I want to remember<br>
This is an endless endeavor<br>
This is pretending we never said forever<br>
<br>
You looked into my eyes<br>
And promised we would die together<br>
<br>
I'd give anything to go back to that moment<br>
