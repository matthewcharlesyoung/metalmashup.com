      <p class="lyrics-test-test">Over and over again<br>
I relive the moment<br>
I'm bearing the burden within<br>
Open wounds hidden under my skin<br>
<br>
Pain is real as a cut that bleeds<br>
The face I see every time I try to sleep<br>
Staring at me crying<br>
<br>
I'm running from the enemy inside<br>
Looking for the life I left behind<br>
These suffocating memories are etched upon my mind<br>
And I can't escape from the enemy inside<br>
<br>
I sever myself from the world<br>
and shut down completely<br>
All alone in my own living hell<br>
overcome with irrational fear<br>
<br>
Under the weight of the world on my chest<br>
I buckle and break as I try to catch my breath<br>
Tell me I'm not dying<br>
<br>
I'm a burden and a travesty<br>
I'm a prisoner of regret<br>
Between the flashbacks and the violent dreams<br>
I am hanging on the edge<br>
<br>
Disaster lurks around the bend<br>
Paradise came to an end<br>
And no magic pill<br>
can bring it back again<br>
<br>
I'm running from the enemy inside<br>
Looking for the life I left behind<br>
These suffocating memories are etched upon my mind<br>
And I can't escape from the enemy inside</p>

      <h1 id="f3" class="lyrics-test">-The Looking Glass-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">I would not expect you felt unnoticed and ignored<br>
Better to rise above the clouds Then be a stranger in the crowd<br>
All that you protected doesn’t matter anymore<br>
Rather be stripped of all your pride<br>
Than watch your dreams be cast aside<br>
<br>
You are caught up in your gravity<br>
Glorifying stardom<br>
Singing your own praise<br>
<br>
You live without shame<br>
You’re digging up a gold mine<br>
Standing on the sidelines<br>
Watching through the looking glass<br>
<br>
You are not content with being nameless and unknown<br>
Trying to rise above the fray<br>
Eager to give it all away<br>
<br>
Some will not admit that 15 minutes have expired<br>
Too much attention much too soon<br>
Don’t see you walking on the moon<br>
<br>
You are caught up in your gravity<br>
Bathing in the spotlight<br>
Imitating fame<br>
<br>
You live without shame<br>
You’re digging up a gold mine<br>
Standing on the sidelines<br>
Watching through the looking glass<br>
<br>
You are caught up in your gravity<br>
Glorifying madness<br>
Singing your own praise<br>
<br>
You live without shame<br>
You’re digging up a gold mine<br>
Standing on the sidelines<br>
Watching through the looking glass<br>
<br>
You live without shame<br>

      <p class="lyrics-test-test">Long before the colors start to bleed<br>
I can see the painting come alive<br>
Clever like an angel in disguise<br>
Moving in and out of reach<br>
<br>
If the candle lights this crooked path<br>
Like a lighthouse peering through the haze<br>
I will find the river through the rain<br>
And I’ll reach the water’s edge<br>
<br>
Shed your light on me<br>
Be my eyes when I can’t see<br>
Shed your light on me<br>
Be my guide so I can see<br>
The Bigger Picture<br>
<br>
Like a moth burned by the fire<br>
and driven to the flame<br>
(Prophecies’ a blessing and a curse)<br>
I must bare this cross alone<br>
There’s no one else to blame<br>
With each treasure found<br>
Another shipwreck’s washed ashore<br>
I am carried by the current<br>
On a slow and steady course<br>
<br>

What If caught in a moment<br>
I get lost and can't find my way<br>
What if all along i was wrong<br>
In every turn, In every way<br>
<br>
Would you talk me off the ledge<br>
Or let me take the fall<br>
Better to try and fail<br>
then to never try at all<br>
<br>
You look but cannot see<br>
Talk but never speak<br>
You live but cannot breathe<br>
See but don’t believe<br>
<br>
Wounds that never heal<br>
A heart that cannot feel<br>
A dream that’s all too real<br>
A stare as cold as steel<br>
<br>
I’ve listened to the stories of resentment and disdain<br>
I’ve looked into the empty eyes of anger, fear, and shame<br>
I’ve taken blood from every stone<br>
And traveled every road<br>
<br>
When I see the distant lights illuminate the night<br>
Then I will know I am home </p>

      <p class="lyrics-test-test">What would possess you to justify<br>
Such dark and twisted ways?<br>
What kind of monster would come to feast<br>
When the devil shows his face?<br>
What does it take for life to change<br>
And a mind to lose control?<br>
Cruelly left you to suffer the blame<br>
After all the lies you told<br>
<br>
I am finding courage in my darkest hour<br>
I am bent, not broken<br>
Calling out<br>
<br>
Someone save me, look behind the veil<br>
Please don't walk away<br>
Someone save me, bring me home tonight<br>
I can't face another day<br>
<br>
Can you see the stranger<br>
Hiding in plain sight?<br>
Feeding on the chaos<br>
When the lightning strikes<br>
There's no redemption<br>
There's no being saved<br>
There's no salvation<br>
For a soul depraved<br>
<br>
You are finding promise in your finest hour<br>
You are bent, not broken<br>

Where heart and mind collide<br>
Self reflection helps me decide<br>
I believe the sacrifices in life<br>
Give more than they take<br>
<br>
Visions flowing slowly shedding light<br>
Memories swimming in the sea of time<br>
Pieces to the puzzle falling into place<br>
That with which we struggle through we’ve learned to embrace<br>
<br>
Love show the way, alter my state of mind<br>
Wash away the sorrow<br>
Grace lead the way<br>
When boundaries are found<br>
Surrender to reason<br>
<br>
Life gives you brighter days<br>
Through sacrifices made<br>
My spirit travels like the wind and waves<br>
My heart and mind unite<br>
Mistakes resolved give sight<br>
The river’s currents slowly turns the stone<br>
<br>
Restless angels<br>
Help me find my way<br>
Restless angels<br>
Help me find my strength<br>
<br>
Restless angels<br>
Help me find my way<br>
Restless angels<br>
Let love show the way<br>
Let grace be the way<br>
Surrender to reason

And my vision's unclear<br>
Blind to the truth<br>
Like hands reaching out in the darkness<br>

I can't stop the world from turning around<br>
Or the pull of the moon on the tide<br>
But I don't believe that we're in this alone<br>
I believe we're along for the ride<br>
I believe we're along for the ride<br>
<br>
Through the gift of surrender<br>
I'm embracing the fight<br>
Breaking the code<br>
There's clarity on the horizon<br>
<br>

I can't stop the world from turning around<br>
Or the pull of the moon on the tide<br>
But I don't believe that we're in this alone<br>
I believe we're along for the ride<br>
I believe we're along for the ride<br>
<br>
I will not live under a shadow of fear<br>
Never be crippled by chaos and doubt<br>
Fall prey to your madness<br>
<br>
I am not shattered<br>
Out of the ashes I rise<br>
Knowing that nothing is stronger than faith<br>
Finding hope in our hopeless lives<br><br>

I can't stop the world from turning around<br>
Or the pull of the moon on the tide<br>
But I don't believe that we're in this alone<br>
I believe we're along for the ride<br>
<br>
I can't stop the world from turning around<br>
Or the pull of the moon on the tide<br>
But I don't believe that we're in this alone<br>

Consider this question<br>
Look deep inside<br>
Deliver a true confession<br>
What are you willing to live for?<br>
<br>
Consider this question<br>
Open your eyes<br>
Examine your own reflection<br>
What are you willing to die for?<br>
<br>
When your backs’ against the wall<br>
And the time's uncertain<br>
Consider this question<br>
No standing by<br>
When flesh and blood are threatened<br>
What are you willing to kill for?<br>
<br>
We seek to understand<br>
We cry with head in hand<br>
<br>
The bridges we build to connect<br>
The distance that makes us forget<br>
Hate dividing us, love reminding us<br>
Of our shared humanity<br>
<br>
Hope can be a shadow fleeting<br>
I would rather die believing<br>
Capture it all in a final act of faith<br>
<br>
We seek to understand<br>
We cry with head in hand<br>

An answer that begs to be found<br>
The beauty we wish to behold<br>
Is never too far away<br>

Vengeance for a crime<br>
Rebels for their freedom<br>
A tyrant for the praise<br>
Cowards for salvation<br>
Money, love, and fame<br>

Noble and brave<br>
Lay down our lives for the cause<br>
Death over shame<br>
Grace before glory<br>

[V. Surrender, Trust & Passion]<br>

To really feel the joy in life<br>
You must suffer through the pain<br>
When you surrender to the light<br>
You can face the darkest days<br>
<br>
If you open up your eyes<br>
And you put your trust in love<br>
On those cold and endless nights<br>
You will never be alone<br>
<br>
Passion glows within your heart<br>
Like a furnace burning bright<br>
Until you struggle through the dark<br>
You’ll never know that you're alive</p>

Threaten the freedom of mankind<br>

Corruption, lust and greed<br>
Define the new nobility<br>
Changing the course of history<br>

Most people struggle to survive<br>
Living a meek existence<br>
While their secluded leader thrives<br>

Our quest for freedom has begun<br><br>
He will be the answer to our prayers<br>

There walks a god among us<br>

But there's a cost with every fight<br>
And Arhys' fight for hope<br>
Cost him his very life</p>

What have you done?<br>
You murderer<br>
My father's dead<br>
Your day will comev
<br>
[Daryus:]<br>
<br>
Don't hold your breath<br>
The night's still young<br>
Confront your death<br>
Like father, like son<br>
<br>
Who's this I see?<br>
Approaching me<br>
The Chosen One?<br>
<br>
[Narrator:]<br>
<br>
Drawing closer pace by pace<br>
The walking shadow hides its face<br>
Never aware of the looming attack<br>
Like stepping right into a trap<br>
<br>
As his weapon<br>
Finds its victim<br>
Mortified,<br>
He's shocked to find<br>
The shadow is Faythe</p>

<br>
Angels above<br>
Have you deceived my eyes?<br>
Be still my love<br>
I won't leave your side<br>
<br>
All my life<br>
I have walked alone<br>
Now I've found my home in you<br>
Only I'm too late<br><br>

Have I wandered into someone's nightmare?<br>
This is more than any heart can bear<br>
<br>
You stole my brother's life<br>
How many more have to die<br>
Before you will open your eyes?<br>
<br>
Don't leave me now<br>
Hold on for one more breath<br>
Stay strong somehow<br>
This can't be the end<br>
<br>
All your life<br>
You have walked alone<br>
Now I am your home<br>
So take my hand and don't let go<br>
<br>
Crushing pain and crippling grief<br>
Nothing like I've ever felt<br>
God above and souls beneath<br>
Hear my last farewell

[Nafaryus:]<br>
<br>
My foolish pride<br>
My selfish heart<br>
Lost in the dark<br>
Blinded by my arrogance<br>
<br>
And now you beg for one last breath<br>
And I'm the one to blame<br>
<br>
There's a reason now I see<br>
The reason you have chosen<br>
To find the light inside of me<br>
If only I believed<br>
<br>
[Arabelle:]<br>
<br>
Here I am<br>
Don't be afraid<br>
I will never let you slip away<br>
<br>
Look my way<br>
You must be brave<br>
Find the strength to live for one more day<br>
<br>
I will keep from losing Faythe<br>
I will ask for grace<br>
And hope will find a way<br>

Like a candle's dying flame<br>
With forgiving eyes<br>
She starts to drift away<br>

[Nafaryus:]<br>

Gabriel, my son<br>
I see the tide is turning<br>
Can The Chosen One<br>
Keep her fire burning?<br>
<br>
I would trade my life<br>
Just for one last moment<br>
<br>
Use your gift I beg<br>
May life begin again<br>
May life begin again

If I still had something left<br>
I'd surely use my gift<br>
To give her one more breath<br>
To see her smile again<br>
And yet my gift is gone<br>
Along with all her dreams<br>
It vanished with a scream<br>
My fragile voice has all but disappeared<br>
I've nothing left to give<br>
The words I wish I'd said<br>
Just whispers on the wind<br>
And now all hope is dead</p>

[Narrator:]<br>
<br>
Out of the shadows<br>
One by one they came<br>
To shed their light upon his moment of doubt and pain<br>
<br>
A thousand voices<br>
Rang out through the night<br>
A symphony of mercy for their savior<br>
Too tired to fight<br>
<br>
And as the chorus grew<br>
A thousand hearts beat true<br>
Then like a glowing beacon in the dark<br>
Hope came shining through<br>
<br>
Amazingly the savior found his voice<br>
And all together they rejoiced<br>
<br>
[Gabriel and Townspeople:]<br>
<br>
Glorious sound<br>
Guide her tonight<br>
Out of the darkness<br>
Into the light<br>
<br>
Merciful song<br>
Set her soul free<br>
Unbind the chains of endless sleep<br>
<br>
Choirs on high<br>
Grant her new life<br>
Make me a vessel of thy boundless grace<br>
Music has shown her the way<br>
She lives today!</p>

[Arhys' Spirit:]<br>
Brother, can you hear me?<br>
His life is in your hands<br>
He is just a child and still too young to understand<br>
Show him love and courage<br>
That freedom knows no bounds<br>
Tell him he could never let me down<br>

[Xander:]<br>
Father, I will make you proud<br>
Rest in peace<br>

[Gabriel:]<br>
I always had the answer<br>
All this time I held the key<br>
And now that I see<br>
The reason to believe<br>
I can be the man who I am meant to be<br>

Because of you I live again<br>
Now I can be a voice for change<br>
And help to build a world that's fair and true<br>

[Nafaryus:]<br>
On the road to revolution<br>
There are lessons to be learned<br>

Was slipping through my hands<br>
Pride and ignorance receded<br>
To reveal a humbled man<br>

You got lost along the way<br>
In light of this new burden that you face<br>
You are forgiven on this day<br>

People, can you hear us?<br>
Peace has been restored<br>
The silence has been broken<br>
Music reigns forever more<br>

We sing a song of freedom<br>
Together we are bound<br>
People, we shall never hold you down<br>
We will build our world on common ground<br>

And we'll live once more<br>
Eternally<br>
In harmony<br>
Our lives will be<br>
Astonishing<br>
Again<br>
