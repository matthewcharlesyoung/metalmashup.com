From morning mist<br>
With sharp blades in mighty fists<br>
One hundred warriors on horse<br>
An awesome brutal force<br><br>

You feel weak and scared<br>
Fear has gripped your heart<br>
You will soon be over run<br>
You will soon be torn apart<br><br>

The Vikings strike<br>
So fast and hard<br>
Those who run won't make it far<br>
And those who chose to stand and fight<br>
They have made the choice to die<br><br>

The weapons tear through flesh and bone<br>
Dying men that scream and moan<br>
With severed limbs<br>
To the hall of death<br><br>

The battlefield is full of death<br>
Feel the stench of rotting flesh<br>
When the entire country burns<br>
As the warriors return<br><br>

And they came out<br>
From morning mist<br>
With sharp blades in mighty fists<br>
They leave this land<br>
All burned and scorn<br>
Those alive will mourn<br><br>

Does he even care for you?<br>

They've kept you down for a thousand years<br><br>

They nurture prejudice and hate<br>
Condemn the wars that they create<br>
In the name of whatever god<br>

They gladly sacrifice your lives<br>
Increasing power is their prize<br>
Without regrets they'll spill your blood<br><br>

They're feeding you lies<br>
With calculating smiles<br>
Enslavement of the human mind<br>
As long as you kneel to their authority<br>
Religion is what makes you blind<br><br>

They're treating you as mindless fools<br>
And use you as obedient tools<br>
It's time to set your spirit free<br><br>

This world we cannot tolerate<br>
It's time to seal all preachers' fate<br>
And let them hang from Oden's tree<br><br>

Your minds are restrained<br>
Obedience is the chain<br>
They've locked you up and thrown away the key<br>
Your souls are for sale,<br>
And you're the ones who pay<br>
But still you'll never be set free<br><br>

They're feeding you lies<br>
With calculating smiles<br>
Enslavement of the human mind<br>
As long as you kneel to their authority<br>
Religion is what makes you blind</p>

We're taught how war is waged<br>
And there are no men now alive<br>
Who stops our wild rampage<br><br>

Light at heart we bide our bane<br>
whatever death awaits!<br>
Norsemen live without regrets<br>
We accept our woven fates<br><br>

So fearlessly we charge ahead<br>
There is no time to hesitate<br><br>

Don't despair, show no fear<br>
Live your life without regrets<br>
Don't despair and show no fear<br>
In the face of a certain death<br><br>

A coward thinks he'll always live<br>
If it keeps himself from strife<br>
Old age leaves no rest and peace<br>
though spears may spare his life<br><br>

We don't mourn a friend that fell<br>
or dread the day we'll fall ourselves<br>
Warriors don't go to Hel<br>
'cause we know Ygg will greet us well!<br><br>

Fearlessly we charge ahead<br>
There is no time to hesitate<br><br>

Don't despair, show no fear<br>
Live your life without regrets<br>
Don't despair and show no fear<br>
In the face of a certain death<br><br>

So raise your horns to those who died<br>
Let's drink to fallen friends tonight<br>
Let's celebrate their glory life<br>
We'll meet again in Valhall when we die<br>
When we die!<br>
When we die!

My hand holds the horn so firm<br>
I am calm and ready to die<br>
Everything around me burns<br>

See him rise from land of flames<br>

To this end my fate is bound<br>

With every gasp<br>

The air is full of a thick<br>

Their eager weapons whip and thrash<br>

A mounted legion<br>
Under my command<br>
We're a brutal force<br>
No men can withstand<br>
Total havoc is at hand<br><br>


See the black crows circle high<br>
Waiting for brave men to die<br>
They sense the coming of the tide<br>
When opposition's swept aside<br><br>

The fateful message<br>
Reached us months ago<br>
That our home was under siege<br>
And since that day<br>
We've been heading north<br>
Our kinsmen needed our relief<br><br>

As we near our fortress walls<br>
Black smoke is rising to the sky<br>
Burnt black ruins<br>
Of our father's halls<br>
And corpses greet our tired eyes<br><br>

What madness led them to attack<br>
Victory could not be won<br>
They must've known<br>
There was no turning back<br>
And now they all are gone<br>
No woman, child or man was spared<br>
Their bodies lying where they fell<br>
Suffering, anguish and despair<br>
As they went through living hell<br><br>

So now we're on the ride again<br>
And vengeance is<br>
Our newfound path<br>
We draw our strength<br>
From grief and pain<br>
These bastards shall know<br>
Our endless wrath<br><br>

          <p class="lyrics-test-test">We were the warriors of the north<br>
Notorious and brave<br>
We'd never lost a fight in war<br>
We feared not the grave<br><br>

The ruler of this northern court<br>
My brother, lord, king<br>
He always had our loyal swords<br>
But we would feel his sting<br><br>

The aging king had no descendants<br>
No heir to take his throne<br>
It filled his soul with fear<br>
Transcendent<br>
That next in line was my first-born<br><br>

The king's heart grew<br>
Full of dark deception<br>
Full of foul conspiracy<br>
This was when dark days<br>
Had their inception<br>
And we fell to his vile deceit<br><br>

Robbed of arms, robbed of pride<br>
But he spared our lives<br>
The fear he had of Oden's wrath<br>
Held his vengeful knife<br><br>

With hearts so cold we left our homes<br>
Banished from our land<br>
A life in shame, a life in grief<br>
Until we rise again<br>

Winters come, winters pass<br>
Twenty wasted years<br>
We're aging men, our youth is gone<br>
We will shed no tears<br>

Winters come and winters pass<br>
Twenty years have gone<br>
Like a dream we fade away<br>
Into oblivion<br><br>

We are the warriors of the north<br>
Notorious and brave<br>
We're old but strong as before<br>
And we don't fear the grave<br><br>

From the south an army rises<br>
They ride under cross of gold<br>
From the shades we're called<br>
In a time of crisis<br>
To defend the king now weak and old<br><br>

As the flames of warfare rage higher<br>
We feel our destiny's embrace<br>
We are aging men of an old empire<br>
Now we can see Valhalla's gates<br><br>

We!<br>
March again<br>
First in line<br>
To reach Valhalla's mighty gates<br>

We!<br>
March again<br>
March to fight<br>
To reach Valhalla's mighty<br>
We!<br>
March again<br>
Give our lives<br>
To reach Valhalla's<br>
Mighty royal gates

            <p class="lyrics-test-test">The first man I killed was the earl's right-hand man<br>
When he came to take her away<br>
I ran his own sword straight through his throat<br>
And then I stood there, watching him fade<br><br>

The first blood I spilled was the blood of a varg<br>
I had to wipe his smile away<br>
I was not yet a man, nor was I a boy<br>
But still, I made that bastard pay<br><br>

So I left him there, on the stable floor<br>
Bathing in a pool of his own blood<br>
My one and only choice was to flee this land<br>
To leave this wretched place for good<br><br>

I am an outcast<br>
All alone<br>
I'm a nomad without home<br><br>

I am an outlaw<br>
I'm disowned<br>
And I am no man's son<br><br>

Through the cold midwinter nights on a southbound winding path<br>
The stars and moon my only light; and the earl's men closing fast<br>
I swore that I'd return; that I would see him burn<br>
I will live it in my dreams; the smell, the blood, his dying screams<br><br>

To my father I was dead, he took his hand from me<br>
He drove me away, I was shunned<br>
My one and only choice was to leave this land<br>
To become the pagan they would hunt<br><br>

I am an outcast<br>
All alone<br>
I'm a nomad without home<br><br>

I am an outlaw<br>
I'm disowned<br>
And I am no man's son<br><br>

I am an outcast<br>

I journey through this frozen land on my own<br>
There's no shelter anywhere down the road<br>
When this mystic wanderer comes around<br>
And the dying hope in my heart starts to grow<br><br>

This vagrant offers help when there was none<br>
To this outlawed murder on the run<br>
Through the snowy mountains we roam<br>
Mu journey towards freedom has now begun<br><br>

On the run<br>
All alone<br>
Hope is gone<br>
Wanderer<br><br>

A blizzard hit with blinding force<br>
The wind cut through the bone<br>
And amidst the blur of snow<br>
I found myself alone<br><br>

Freezing winds brought me down<br>
I laid myself to rest<br>
In the deep, chilling cold<br>
I knew I'd freeze to death<br><br>

Left alone I had no choice<br>
But to accept my fate<br>
When the wanderer returned<br>
Then I knew that my life was saved<br><br>

On the run<br>
All alone<br>
Hope is gone<br>

Not alone<br>

Silence deafens, the sea is mirror calm<br>
Blood runs like the water from my palm<br><br>

I'm standing by myself<br>
Abiding<br>
Just me and no one else<br>
No hiding<br><br>

Horizon crumbles under flaming skies<br>
A shadow screams from thunderclouds up high<br>
Nidhogg comes in winds of burning flames<br>
Cast down war and endless pain<br><br>

Lost in a dreadful dream I'll meet my fate<br><br>

Out on this blood sea, this is my prophecy<br>
A notion of what's to be, there's no escape<br><br>

The dragon sweeps down with a roar<br>
Sky and ocean shake<br>
It tears up waves of blood and gore<br>
The longship nearly breaks<br><br>

Passing just above my head<br>
A stench of putrid death<br>
Rotting flesh of thousands dead<br>
Dwells upon its breath<br><br>

I turn around<br>
Face myself<br>
Yet it isn't I<br>
With fear and rage<br>
I run me through<br>

As hope grows stronger in his heart<br>
It's easier to breathe<br><br>

Days turn into nights<br>
Nights turn into days<br>
His determination grows<br>
With every breath he takes<br><br>

There he stands alone, one man against all<br>
With a sword in each hand, soon he will fall<br>
There he stands alone, one man against all<br>
With a sword in each hand, heeding the call<br><br>

When the reach the Hano bay<br>
There waits a ship of war<br>
Like the bear attacks its prey<br>
It comes at them with force<br><br>

All men to the oars!<br>
Row for all your worth!<br>
Most likely this will be your last day<br>
On this wretched earth!<br><br>

The weak they try to run<br>
But he's prepared to fight<br>
One by one his friends are slain<br>
Only he remains<br><br>

He knows the end is near<br>
They have him in their jaws<br>
When a noble man appears<br>
He tells them, "Withdraw!"<br><br>

There he stands before him<br>
As the skirmish quells<br>
He offers him,<br>
"Join our crew or join your friends in hell."<br><br>

There he stands alone, one man against all<br>
With a sword in each hand, and soon he will fall<br>
There he stands alone, one man against all<br>
With a sword in each hand, he's heeding the call

For him it's much too late<br>
He puts his back into the oar<br>
And rows towards his fate<br><br>

The ship cuts through<br>
The milk white mist<br>
Through the blind they clearly hear<br>
The oar strokes of their mighty fleet<br>
Battle's drawing near<br>
His heart pounds loud and wild<br>
He's waited for this day<br>
Then suddenly a dragon's head<br>
Appears out of the haze<br><br>

Back on the Northern shores<br>
Just as he once swore<br>
He vowed to return<br>
And to make them burn<br><br>

Then a Northern wind picks up<br>
It sweeps the mist away<br>
A might viking fleet appears<br>
Patiently they wait<br>
"Death or victory!"<br>
Words by which they stand<br>
No turning back! In for the kill!<br>
Led by thy command!<br><br>

"All men grab your swords and shields<br>

Cries of war as weapons clash<br>
Uncertain who will win<br><br>

Thunder rolls 'cross the waves<br>
Lightning cracks the sky<br>
Clouds release hail big as grapes<br>
As arrows are let fly<br><br>

Hear the berserks roar!<br>
They call to mighty Thor!<br>
The fury in their raging eyes<br>
Will burn forever more<br>
Hear the weapons sing!<br>
Feel the arrows sting!<br>
They climb onto the Earl's great ship<br>
And begin to swing<br><br>

The fight is fierce as they attack<br>
With sword and axe, no guts, no glory!<br>
Arrow pierced, they won't back down<br>
They battle on with heart and fury<br>
Then it turns<br>
The flanking ships give way<br>
And soon they are embattled<br>
Standing firm! Fight 'til death!<br>
They refuse to die like cattle<br><br>

Fighting for his life<br>
No holds barred<br>
So close to revenge<br>
Close but yet so far<br><br>

Then he stands before him<br>
It's like the battle fades<br>
He sees his father's eyes<br>

In these cold dark waves<br><br>

He looks to clouds up high<br>
A dead and distant stare<br>
She comes out of the light<br>
See the chariot flare<br>
Standing on the shore<br>
He hears her silent call<br>
Freja leads him through the door<br>
Into the great hall
