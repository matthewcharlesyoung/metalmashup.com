Desperately opiate, weary<br>
Feverish host to us, teary eyed<br>

Don't look. Don't think<br>
Don't feel. Don't move. Don't breathe<br>
Don't make a sound. It lives. It breathes<br>

You couldn't cope in all honesty<br>
The secrets of the past will come undone<br>

Faithfully until the day you die<br>

No, something's not right. Open your arms to the sky. Focus the light<br>
It's a combination of numbers, oh and a set of missing keys<br>
I've been painting pictures but the colors disagree<br>
And bad things come in threes<br>

The wind is blowing<br>
I am falling through a hurricane as buildings tear up from the ground<br>
No way of knowing where I'm going,<br>
circulating through the wildest night<br>
Given to the sudden urges for more<br>
Something's not right. Open your arms to the sky. Focus the light<br>
I've been, I've been painting pictures<br>
I can't, I just can't taste of freedom<br>
I've been, I've been painting pictures<br>
Stuck in a room full of voices, with nobody to be seen<br>
I can sense the danger as the colors now agree<br>
And the picture is obscene<br>

The wind is blowing<br>
I am falling through a hurricane as<br>
buildings tear up from the ground<br>

You know that I can’t, I just can’t (can’t) taste the freedom<br>

You're the menace of the night, inquisitive to my request<br>
And I ask, "Do you have the discretion, assiduity, freedom?"<br>

And I can't deal with the vice below<br>
And I knew that it was wrong; I denied you all along<br>

I am the prisoner<br>

This is abandoned love<br>
