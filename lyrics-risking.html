      <p class="lyrics-test-test">I left it all behind.<br>
Destroyed the message.<br>
I left it all behind.<br>
Never scoping it out from my own perspective.<br>
I left it all behind.<br>
Every time I start over my heart feels colder.<br>
<br>
There's nothing left inside, I guess that's what it feels like.<br>
What it feels like to grow older.<br>
<br>
Dismembered every emotion that died with the past.<br>
I can't fill all the blank spaces.<br>
<br>
We were lost and I swear I couldn't find your traces.<br>
We've been distant but so close, it burns.<br>
Departing embers, but still burning forever.<br>
<br>
I will never see my own life the same again!<br>
I will never see my own life the same again!</p>

      <h1 id="f2" class="lyrics-test">-In Perspective-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">We're feeding our fears,<br>
Denying failure when it's crystal fucking clear.<br>
So you poison their minds.<br>
Watch them paralyzed.<br>
Running in circles to the finish line.<br>
<br>
We all have different views and the ones in between.<br>
Because our heads are underneath<br>
A heavy weight of our reasoning.<br>
Tied between wishful thinking and struck constantly<br>
With fears that we will all die someday.<br>
Some day!<br>
<br>
We give our faith<br>
So we can be kept safe.<br>
<br>
Not wanting to expire without making a dent<br>
Or thinking afterwards that you can see old faces again.<br>
Without making a dent...<br>
I'll never see those old faces again.<br>
<br>
I took one last look.<br>
<br>
Focus on the life set in front of you.<br>
Everyday change makes me reevaluate my attitude.<br>
Try harder than the person standing next to you<br>
'Cause selection of the best<br>
Brings down the hope we thought would get us through.<br>
<br>
Never settle for anything less than what you reserved.<br>
The past defines you, but not what you can do<br>
'Cause change is all we need to grasp the future we strive for.<br>
And pushing ourselves there is something I would die for.<br>
It's something I would die for.</p>

      <h1 id="f3" class="lyrics-test">-Repetition Of History-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">The demonstrations<br>
that we set are engraved forever,<br>
The tole our minds take from such little demeanor.<br>
Don't let difference be a reason for hatred,<br>
Disabled thoughts of a failed evolution.<br>
<br>
The fear has settled in the back of our heads,<br>
And we can't seem to process what we're setting loose.<br>
Divided thoughts bring back the difference we hate,<br>
And short term thinking leaves no time to relate.<br>
<br>
Now the time is running out, morality's on its last leg.<br>
I resent your decisions and hope you find some remorse in your mistakes.<br>
Inevitable by default we have put ourselves here.<br>
<br>
Irrationality flowing through the roots,<br>
Killing off the people you have used.<br>
The people that you raised,<br>
To a tunnel visioned future that there would be better days.<br>
<br>
The repetition of history,<br>
That we have not learned.<br>
Taught me to dig deeper, to find the hidden truth.<br>
Corrupted from our births,<br>
Defected without choice.<br>
If it's my life you want, I'll show you what I'm really worth.<br>
<br>
I only see illness, there's no love to take.<br>
From your fucked up faith, that tried to set us in place.<br>
<br>
Another sick mindset of the human race.</p>

      <h1 id="f4" class="lyrics-test">-Hear Me Out-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">I had a vision of what life could be,<br>
And it will never be.<br>
I had potential hidden deep in me,<br>
But I was raised with a lie.<br>
You'll never fix me, I'll never let you in.<br>
I died along with my dreams<br>
So don't relieve me of anything.<br>
<br>
Ignore the facts before your eyes.<br>
You have rejected every chance you get to breath in new life.<br>
You just force a message down my throat<br>
That you can't even explain.<br>
<br>
When I prove my point again<br>
You fail to recognize where my conscious lays.<br>
Realize beliefs are not reality.<br>
Fail to recognize...<br>
Realize that beliefs are not reality.<br>
<br>
I spent everyday, every second<br>
Pondering about a plan that will never drill<br>
Through your bulletproof skull.<br>
<br>
I waste my time casting out my own good.<br>
There's no point standing in the holes where hope stood.<br>
I waste my time casting out my own good.<br>
There's no point in standing in the holes where hope stood.<br>
<br>
Glorify the absence of sanity.<br>
Relieving your pain?<br>
Or are you putting your own faith to vain?<br>
Are you putting your own faith to vain?</p>

      <h1 id="f5" class="lyrics-test">-Novak-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">Our fragile minds were sheltered off<br>
To hide from our shadowing vice.<br>
I took it for granted.<br>
How easily it slipped from our sight.<br>
<br>
I always see it in your eyes.<br>
You wished you chased your ambitions,<br>
But you fell apart.<br>
After you left I ran away,<br>
But I will never find a safe place<br>
To escape these days.<br>
<br>
I'm so fucked.<br>
<br>
When I see your face now,<br>
It reminds me that we both had dreams,<br>
And even if you can't live free,<br>
I will walk into the dark until I find your light<br>
To bring back home with me.<br>
<br>
Living on through hope and misery.<br>
I will set you free.<br>
<br>
I know you're drenched in empathy,<br>
I'm struggling to feel anything.<br>
The storm made me close my eyes,<br>
You weren't yourself anymore,<br>
You didn't expect to be left dry,<br>
And I regret trailing you from behind.<br>
<br>
I keep running into closed doors<br>
Hoping to open one and find you in my life.<br>
The flame you left in me is stronger than before.<br>
You're burning me alive.<br>
<br>
When your heart shines so will mine.</p>

      <h1 id="f6" class="lyrics-test">-Lifeless-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">I would give up everything<br>
to make you feel safe,<br>
Sometimes only words can make you feel this way.<br>
We need a voice to impact what we are today,<br>
I'm standing here 'cause there's a lot I need to say.<br>
<br>
We live for greed.<br>
We are the hand that causes violence.<br>
We aren't grateful for our lives.<br>
We'll live our whole life in denial.<br>
<br>
I see them lost in vague direction everything is a blur.<br>
I want to clear things up to them, so they know for sure<br>
There's a road to follow; I know. I've been there before.<br>
Follow down this path and I will take you home.<br>
<br>
As life goes on we will only get worse.<br>
The clocks running out and we stand by and watch.<br>
If there's no time left, then there can be no change.<br>
We'll sit and we'll burn and do nothing but wait.<br>
<br>
What the fuck!<br>
<br>
I see them lost in vague direction, everything's a blur.<br>
I want to clear things up to them, so they know for sure<br>
There's a road to follow; I know, I've been there before.<br>
Follow me down this path and I will take you home.</p>

      <h1 id="f7" class="lyrics-test">-Gray-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">I'm back again at the start of it all.<br>
I can't seem to find the end.<br>
All the things I used to have and everything I used to love,<br>
I watched them fade.<br>
<br>
Everyone I knew and everything that they taught me<br>
Has made me gray.<br>
There's no motivation in me, no fire in my chest.<br>
You took it all, you took it all.<br>
Where's my recollection of that feeling,<br>
I feel like it's been gone for too long.<br>
Can't it just take me away, and clear up my head?<br>
So I can stop this decay.<br>
<br>
All these gold linings are a reminder<br>
Of the ground that I don't walk on.<br>
Shattered bones and mountains to climb,<br>
But there's no path to follow from the trails of the hollow.<br>
<br>
The fabrication of this life hasn't let the light bleed through,<br>
But bleed me instead.<br>
It hasn't let the light bleed through.<br>
It's bleeding me from the inside.<br>
<br>
There's a gap inside that can stretch for miles<br>
All my choices at each edge.<br>
But I am lost within their depth.<br>
<br>
It seems I pushed myself too far and now<br>
The soul that gave me life is deposit in the ground.<br>
Fuck!<br>
<br>
All these gold linings are a reminder<br>
Of the ground that I don't walk on.<br>
Shattered bones and mountains to climb,<br>
But there's no path to follow from the trails of the hollow.</p>

      <h1 id="f8" class="lyrics-test">-Wasteland-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">They've lied a<br>
thousand times to make us feel like we belong,<br>
When we should have the choice of where our actions cross.<br>
It's not fucking drawn. There's no freedom in this cage we built.<br>
So stop acting like it's worth it when you see the blood they spilt.<br>
<br>
I should've seen this coming,<br>
I guess we've gone too far.<br>
It's gone. It's gone. That's easy to see,<br>
But we keep living on in our own make believe.<br>
We'll finish what you started,<br><br>
Don't waste another day.<br>
Buried beneath their intentions,<br>
Unaware of what the actions made weigh.<br>
<br>
It's just a memory of a place.<br>
Get up!<br>
<br>
I can't lay my head at night and not be afraid<br>
Of losing a friend; losing a love.<br>
It's hard to see the best of this place<br>
And deep down we all know it's too late to make change.<br>
<br>
There's still a solace of light<br>
That will make you glimpse away<br>
From this golden plated mess we made,<br>
Where everything entitled to you doesn't mean a thing.<br>
I remember life was serial to see.<br>
Now I try to capture every image in my head<br>
How it used to be;<br>
The moments where I felt a sign of positivity.<br>
But now all the morals I had are gone.<br>
<br>
I should've seen this coming,<br>
I guess we've gone too far.<br>
It's gone. It's gone. That's easy to see,<br>
But we keep living on in our own make believe.<br>
We'll finish what you started,<br>
Don't waste another day.<br><br>
Buried beneath their intentions,<br>
Unaware of what the actions made weigh.<br>
<br>
Not even God can save us!</p>

      <h1 id="f9" class="lyrics-test">-The Nasty J-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">I've pushed away every<br>
part of me that ever tried to care,<br>
'Cause living in this place can get inside your head<br>
And tear you from what you were, from who you are, to just a pawn.<br>
<br>
Moving in one direction is starting to drag on.<br>
<br>
I am afflicted by the ones who took away my love for this place.<br>
I only see hollow skies and rumors we can't trace, we can't erase.<br>
<br>
But I'm not trying to hide,<br>
I've just been peeling off dead skin.<br>
The space between sanity and losing my mind<br>
Is just so thin.<br>
<br>
It's hard to break off old habits and let them all die,<br>
'Cause we both know<br>
I was never good with goodbyes.<br>
So goodbye!<br>
<br>
Every fiber of my being is disgusted to see,<br>
Such a tragic fucking ending this world turned out to be,<br>
Every fiber of my being is disgusted to see,<br>
Such a tragic fucking ending this world turned out to be.<br>
<br>
Maybe I can try to get past this,<br>
But I'm so washed up, I can't seem to fight it.<br>
I know it's not to late to change my ways,<br>
To leave this place, and stay the fuck away.<br>
<br>
Throw it all away!<br>
If you think its worth it, throw it all away!<br>
I can't believe it's worth it.</p>

      <h1 id="f10" class="lyrics-test">-Searching For Defeat-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">If you can't stand to see me happy,<br>
I'm sorry I ever came.<br>
I'm here to ruin your life anyways.<br>
I'm here to ruin your life anyways.<br>
<br>
If the walls we built come down one day,<br>
Is it because you suppressed me!<br>
<br>
How can they say I should've held on?<br>
That this is all just in my head.<br>
Am I too blind to see the things I lost?<br>
I think I'm losing it again.<br>
<br>
I think I'm losing it again.<br>
<br>
Don't forgive me. Just forget me.<br>
The road I paved is out to get me.<br>
Every second's always filled with doubt<br>
You made me feel casted out,<br><br>
Now I can't get that feeling out.<br>
I'll keep collecting my thoughts<br>
And proving you wrong.<br>
<br>
The force that cripples you and me isn't our defeat.<br>
The force that cripples you and me isn't our defeat.<br>
I still believe<br>
The force that cripples you and me isn't our defeat.<br>
<br>
How can they say I should've held on?<br>
That this is all just in my head.<br>
Am I too blind to see the things I lost?<br>
I think I'm losing it again.<br>
I thought God would save me,<br>
But you were there instead.<br>
<br>
Challenging me to move on;<br>
To pick up this cold soul<br>
and breathe in life again.<br>
<br>
To think that this whole time...<br>
I just needed to think. I just needed to think.<br>
I just needed to think for myself.</p>
