      <p class="lyrics-test-test">Crushing tectonic structures<br>
We are on a road with no return<br>
Witness the hatred volcano eruptions<br>
The flames are heating the air and we burn<br>
<br>
The core that we long to reach<br>
Has made our lifespans limited<br>
This is a one-way road,<br>
Into the void of infinity<br>
<br>
The core that we long to reach<br>
Will leave a burning mark<br>
This is a one-way road,<br>
Into the void of eternal dark<br>
<br>
The last parade of death<br>
With horsemen in command<br>
Breaking ancient boulders to pieces<br>
The lost world has kneeled<br>
And prays for an end<br>
Spilling red lava all over our treaties<br>
Turning to stone every being<br>
That helped the curse extend<br>
<br>
The core that we long to reach<br>
Has made our lifespans limited<br>
This is a one-way road,<br>
Into the void of infinity<br>
<br>
The core that we long to reach<br>
Will leave a burning mark<br>
This is a one-way road,<br>
Into the void of eternal dark</p>

      <p class="lyrics-test-test">It's about time for the last eerie circle to close<br>
It's the reckoning day with no truth to expose<br>
<br>
Humanity's legacy soon will be lost,<br>
We'll turn another page to dust<br>
The things that were done we couldn't prevent,<br>
Look what their free will has done to us<br>
<br>
The hurricane will crush all of your dreams<br>
The outburst will make even people's hopes perish<br>
The rocks with no souls keeping history streams<br>
A tombstone over the earth<br>
The last thing that's been left to cherish<br>
<br>
True face of destruction,<br>
Eternal death<br>
<br>
The rocks with no souls keeping history streams<br>
A tombstone over the earth<br>
The last thing that's been left to cherish

      <h1 id="f4" class="lyrics-test">-The Agony-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">The eyes are slowly closing, miraculous world fades,<br>
The artist cleans the brushes, takes away the paints,<br>
The picture's finished yet it's only shades<br>
The earth's devoid of life and engulfed in flames<br>
<br>
The agony bursts in memories of hollow songs and empty prayers<br>
The evil eyes and filthy tongues are more than just nightmares<br>
<br>
The agony bursts<br>
In memories of past battles,<br>
Victories and defeats<br>
<br>
You run corner to corner longing for an end<br>
Your agony's your power outlet,<br>
Your end is the beginning,<br>
Still you should make amends<br>
<br>
The power you've possessed is gone<br>
Your agony's your power outlet,<br>
Your end is the beginning, still you should make amends<br>
<br>
The old and the young,<br>
Alive and the dead<br>
Are now taking part in the feast

      <h1 id="f5" class="lyrics-test">-Infinite Fields-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">The all-seeing eye, open the world for me,<br>
A dimension of plains and flourishing fields<br>
My eyes are too dry to bleed<br>
<br>
Frozen spaces shackled with colds<br>
Deep hidden waters are shaping the stones<br>
<br>
The rebelling forests do not let us see,<br>
They've hidden the cloudy skies<br>
Behind seven seals<br>
<br>
We were unjust, we don't deserve mercy<br>
We've killed the nature,<br>
Abused all of our forces<br>
We're the taint of destruction,<br>
We purify all that we see<br>
Infinite and empty fields<br>
<br>
We've killed the nature,<br>
Abused all of our forces<br>
We're the taint of destruction,<br>
We purify all that we see<br>
Infinite empty fields<br>
<br>
The shackles<br>
We've broken and fit brought us doom,<br>
Are now buried deep<br>
And constricted by roots<br>
<br>
The all-seeing eye, opens the world<br>
<br>
So what happens now?<br>
Have we won, or we've lost?<br>
We've stopped the extinction,<br>
But what was the cost?<br>
<br>
Whether all we've created can be dispelled<br>
<br>
The new era's coming, the future will tell<br>
Whether all we've created can be dispelled</p>

      <h1 id="f6" class="lyrics-test">-Incipience-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">This tiny tree that is to grow up<br>
It was the seed and it will smolder<br>
Time breaks everything down,<br>
And death touches everything<br>
And riders of death are always on guard<br>
<br>
Destroying everything and showing no mercy,<br>
They create new law<br>
The signs that come along with the thunderstorm slow time<br>
<br>
Stopping the time and catching the moment<br>
We're afraid to walk into the abyss of unknown<br>
We're afraid to decide<br>
We're not ready for what is to come but still is not shown<br>
<br>
Fear fades away, myriads of pictures go by<br>
Pain goes away and the fire dies out<br>
The riders are here<br>
And they know what needs to be done<br>
<br>
Destroying everything and showing no mercy,<br>
They create the new law<br>
The signs that come along with the thunderstorm slow time</p>

      <h1 id="f7" class="lyrics-test">-Fragile-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">A fragile creation<br>
You are a start of an idea<br>
You are the end of someone's rule,<br>
The end of someone's rule<br>
<br>
You are the new discovered virus.<br>
Make us stronger<br>
We don't need your poisoned guidance,<br>
Maker save your breath<br>
Dot the i's, you are the token of new order<br>
A newly started life or yet another death<br>
<br>
The deserts once a blazing fire<br>
Now have a colder border<br>
The rivers that were giving life<br>
Are gonna take it back<br>
<br>
Cold ocean is so close,<br>
It's washing the dead shores<br>
The eternal stones<br>
We're our own death row<br>
<br>
You are the new discovered virus,<br>
Make us stronger<br>
We don't need your poisoned guidance,<br>
Maker save your breath<br>
Dot the i's, you are the token of new order<br>
A newly started life or yet another death<br>
<br>
A fragile being has shattered the balance<br>
It's a new start that<br>
Will bring a new end<br>
Alive masterpieces burn down their creators<br>
The worlds are the castles<br>
That were made of sand</p>

      <h1 id="f8" class="lyrics-test">-The Betrayer Of Time-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">And again I'm coming back in my mind<br>
To the day when I have first opened my eyes<br>
Cold is burrowing under my skin,<br>
Fear is crippling me<br>
<br>
I've seen the ruins of fortresses,<br>
The ashes of manuscripts<br>
I've heard the cracking sounds from the walls<br>
Buildings collapsed,<br>
All that's left are the wastelands and dust<br>
<br>
I'm the betrayer of time<br>
In my heart there's only ashes and emptiness<br>
I'm the betrayer of time<br>
And I'm the only survivor that's left<br>
<br>
Now the whole world is in my hands<br>
And I'm going to show it the bitter end<br>
<br>
All that I cherished faded away<br>
I have nothing left<br>
<br>
I'm the betrayer of time<br>
In my heart there's only ashes and emptiness<br>
I'm the betrayer of time<br>
And I'm the only survivor that's left<br>
<br>
I'm the betrayer of time<br>
I'm the betrayer of time</p>

      <h1 id="f9" class="lyrics-test">-Cold Winds-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">The cold breath of winds will touch the white plains<br>
And blow the fresh snow off the trees in deep slumber<br>
The eternal blizzard remembers your vital remains<br>
Remaining a glacier<br>
<br>
The forest surrounding is in fact a closed gate<br>
The road back is hidden in snow and it's going to fade<br>
<br>
The endless silence<br>
The sound of thunder breaks it and shows its might<br>
Frozen sky shining<br>
The light is fading, face the eternal night<br>
<br>
The forest surrounding is in fact a closed gate<br>
The road back is hidden in snow and it's going to fade<br>
<br>
We are buried in snowstorm, we are deadly encumbered<br>
The cold breath of winds will touch the white plains<br>
And blow the fresh snow off the trees in deep slumber

Essence of life a mystery<br>

No present reality, for a future to exist<br>

Stay and wait for me<br>
There are so many things I want to say<br>
But haven't yet<br>
Call from the void<br>
Call of the instinct from the wastelands of your inner mind<br>
<br>
We've ruined your future<br>
There is no hope in faith<br>
You're born free<br>
It's time to pay your debt<br>
And everyone will forget about his conscience<br>
Then it's time to choose: to live or to die<br>
<br>
But you are all already dead<br>
But there's still a chance to rewrite fate<br>
Show who you really are<br>
And become a part of absolute will<br>

Strength means nothing<br>
Those that are weak<br>
Men not honest with themselves<br>
Don't be afraid of your feelings<br>
Singularity is not a vice<br>
<br>
There are no dreams no future no past<br>
The price that I have to pay<br>
For ideas, I will never believe<br>

Stay and wait for me<br>
There are so many things I want to say<br>
But haven't yet<br>
Call from the void<br>
Call of the instinct, from the wastelands of your inner mind<br>

You'll face your fears, you'll not see the light<br>
Through infinite years, of your miserable life<br>
Mental and physical sparks unite<br>
And collision has now taken<br>
Your right to decide<br>

They were fading away<br>
Only ashes and smolder<br>
Millions of years<br>

In the previous experience<br>
The rising, evocation of a dream<br>
Of an ultimate existence<br>

Future turned reality<br>
A crystal insight. No compromise<br>
The world of an universal will<br>
General will<br>
<br>
Timeless machine of life<br>
For those who don't dream<br>
Aimless, without pain nor fear<br>
Survival is a main purpose<br>
<br>
No more silly mistakes<br>
Blood frozen in their veins<br>
Evolution, reached it's peak<br>
Now begins a new golden age<br>
<br>
We've built the life on murderers graves<br>
It's pure (it's pure)<br>
<br>
Temple of the light<br>
And each is a part of a mechanism<br>
Harmony, profound of peace<br>

We've built the life on murderers graves<br>
It's pure (it's pure).

Step by step<br>
I am still running<br>
Through a labyrinth of doors I have already entered<br>
Is this my voice?<br>
The water it rises<br>
Will I regret starting this nightmare<br>

Open your eyes<br>
You only can see<br>

There is no cure<br>
There is no cure<br>

There is no cure<br>
'Cause you carry the virus<br>
You try to resign yourself<br>

Got my hands out of dirt<br>
Dust in eyes not for those who can't lie<br>

No more borders free of all chains<br>

Wretched worms are behind<br>

I've already seen this plot<br>
Worlds of jealousy and ambition<br>
Roll this boulder up again and again<br>
Prison of someone's creation<br>

Then the universe shows it's real face<br>
Decorations become a wall<br>
A wall that I can never reach<br>
And there's nowhere I can go<br><br>

I left<br>
A temporary barrier behind<br>
Into the unknown without hesitation<br>
I inhale the air<br>

Nothing like the links<br>
Prospectives of a world that no longer exists<br>
