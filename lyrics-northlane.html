The demons will come<br>
And I will be torn apart (apart, apart, apart, apart...)<br>

Exposing my weakness the world will see<br>
What I never, what I never, what I never fucking wanted<br>

As I stare at your face, soaked in disgrace<br>
What is the price, a judgment of life<br>
I cry out in this dispossession<br>

Exposing my weakness the world will see<br>
What I never, what I never, what I never fucking wanted<br>
<br>
They crowd around me<br>
Here to take their share of my mind<br>
I can no longer<br>
Muster the strength to face them alone, all on my own<br>
<br>
They whisper echoes in unknown tongues<br>
I refuse to absorb their toxic words<br>
I've forgotten how to love<br>
Searching behind locked doors in my mind<br>

Amongst the chaos of this world<br>
And the overwhelming tide of responsibility<br>
I remember how long it's been since I've felt warmth within my heart<br>

A cold world where love would transcend this dimension<br>
A continuous source of inspiration<br>

And I've been waiting for all of my, all my life<br>
I've been searching for something to put my faith into, to give my life to you<br>

This blistering cold, I've grown so fond of left me in a heartless state<br>

And after all these years I've finally realised that<br>
maybe I was never meant to love, or be loved<br>
And if you want to run away<br>
I can take you there<br>

Day after day I searched for answers<br>
As time went by I grew further away from who I was<br>

I felt lost chasing a ghost<br>
I might never find<br>
But what I found I wasn't prepared for<br>
Everywhere I look I see crime without punishment<br>
I just didn't know where to begin<br>

I am holding onto what bit of sanity I have left<br>
I am holding onto what bit of sanity I have left<br>
<br>
Come fight with me my brothers<br>
And claim our world that's been violated by the hands of the corrupt<br>
I am but one, but together we hold the key to a new dawn of prosperity<br>
<br>
We've created a seed that has spread to the core of humanity<br>
Killing itself from the inside, unintentional suicide<br>
<br>
Money and corruption ruin the land<br>
Crooked politicians betray the working man<br>
Pocketing the profits, treating us like sheep<br>
We're tired of hearing promises we know they'll never keep<br>
<br>
I will become the end of this sad and bleak corruption that reigns on all<br>

Sewn together with the strands of lament I'll cloak myself<br>
in a veil of remorse and regret that keep me<br>

So as I walk through the street eyes and voices consume my mind,<br>
they stare ambiguously<br>
<br>
Here I am with all my insecurities, all my imperfections,<br>
crying out to a world that just won't listen<br>
Lend me your ears, your hearts and your<br>
minds and discover what's missing<br>
<br>
These words are the only thing keeping me from<br>
falling into the darkness where my thoughts are no longer my own<br>
In the arms of my kin, my family<br>
In the hearts of those sincere<br>
In the face of adversity<br>
Here I am<br>
Here I am<br>
<br>
Free from hindrance, from all doubt,<br>
from all the voices calling me out<br>
Free from hindrance, from all doubt,<br>
from all the voices calling me out<br>

Here I am pouring my mind and heart into a world that doesn't listen<br>

Remember, you are not alone<br>
You are not alone<br>

In a world that drips in colour</p>

            <p class="lyrics-test-test">Rise up<br>
<br>
Rise up<br>
Break free as one,<br>
See through the eyes of the sun<br>
Witness the bitter end of all<br>
<br>
We peeled our stares from the mysteries of the universe,<br>
And drew them down onto each other<br>
A waterfall of knowledge cascaded into bullets for our brothers<br>
Led to our deaths by providence<br>
When we were born to discover<br>
<br>
We were born to discover<br>
Humankind, seek the sky<br>
That we were born to discover<br>
<br>
Wash away utopia with the tears of the undead<br>
Slipping, sliding, fighting our way down the steepest descent<br>
We'll meet our fate<br>
Spellbound primates bathed in red<br>
Witness the bitter end<br>
<br>
Told to be a delusion,<br>
We cast and sealed our seeds of evolution,<br>
Wisdom age old, dormant inside all<br>
Until it's time to break the mold.<br>
<br>
Break free as one<br>
See through the eyes of the sun<br>
Break free as one<br>
See through the eyes of the sun<br>
Look down at our earth<br>
Through the eyes of the sun<br>
Humankind's lines don't divide<br>
Through the eyes of the sun<br>
<br>
Rise up<br>
Break free as one</p>

            <p class="lyrics-test-test">In an age where stars only draw us in<br>
Gaze is swept from our mother who birthed us here<br>
She's stormy, doubted and over-relied on<br>
Take a good long look at that horizon<br>
<br>
We bleed it dry<br>
We multiply<br>
And soon we'll say it's time to fly<br>
So scorch the host<br>
<br>
Silenced by the solar wind<br>
Forests evergreen wither to sand<br>
There's still shade in this wasteland<br>
Shadows of towering glass span<br>
As far as you can set your sights on<br>
Take a good long look at that horizon<br>
<br>
We bleed it dry<br>
We multiply<br>
And soon we'll say it's time to fly<br>
So scorch the host<br>
<br>
She's stormy, doubted and over-relied on<br>
She's stormy, doubted and over-relied on<br>
She's stormy, doubted and over-relied on<br>
Take a good long look at that horizon<br>
<br>
Open your eyes<br>
Two worlds collide<br>
Open your eyes<br>
<br>
We bleed it dry<br>
We multiply<br>
And soon we'll say it's time to fly<br>
So scorch the host and watch it die<br>
<br>
Watch it die</p>

            <p class="lyrics-test-test">I'm breathing just to pass the time<br>
I forgot to eat tonight<br>
Just running down the clock today<br>
With hope the ache will go away<br>
<br>
Body starts to shake<br>
Head begins to spin<br>
Leaves me in its wake<br>
I'm paralyzed with pain<br>
<br>
We suffer in a heartmachine<br>
Unstable feeling everything<br>
Pins and needles stitching up my skin<br>
We suffer trapped in a heartmachine<br>
<br>
Hope is strange, sometimes it leads you on<br>
There's no exception<br>
When you're halfway gone<br>
A second chance flash of light that brought me to my knees<br>
A burning vision etched in memories<br>
<br>
Body starts to shake<br>
Head begins to spin<br>
Leaves me in its wake<br>
I'm paralyzed with pain<br>
<br>
We suffer in a heartmachine<br>
Unstable feeling everything<br>
Pins and needles stitching up my skin<br>
We suffer trapped in a heartmachine<br>
<br>
Time heals the wounds<br>
It builds up strength inside<br>
Facing the truth, there's nothing left to hide<br>
<br>
We suffer<br>
Unstable<br>
Pins and needles<br>
We suffer trapped in a heartmachine</p>

            <p class="lyrics-test-test">Why<br>
Do we subscribe<br>
To a universal thread<br>
That weaves the fabric of our lives<br>
Ask why<br>
Without batting an eye<br>
We're so accepting<br>
Question everything<br>
Question everything you know<br>
<br>
Fracture of doubt,<br>
Crack to a chasm in an instant<br>
Swallowing whole<br>
The broken bones of our broken home<br>
Into an ocean of disorder<br>
But my view through the water's crystal clear,<br>
And I've got something that you need to hear.<br>
<br>
We don't know who we are, we wander never knowing<br>
Feudal stone walls stop these oceans overflowing<br>
<br>
Virtuosos wrote your thoughts in a symphony<br>
Paradigms, transcribed<br>
Under the supervision of conductors<br>
To our dissonant chorus,<br>
We orchestrate their composition,<br>
They call it order<br>
<br>
We don't know who we are, we reap what we are sewing<br>
Fabric of our lives catches our eyes we abide unknowing<br>
<br>
Wander,<br>
Question<br>
Find your<br>
Obsession knowledge beckons<br>
Find your<br>
Obsession<br>
<br>
We don't know who we are, we wander never knowing<br>
We don't know who we are or why we are following<br>
This script of reality<br>
Where we become the casualty<br>
Conditioned in<br>
An intellectual prison<br>
Fuck this system<br>
<br>
Follow your intuition<br>
<br>
Wander,<br>
Question<br>
Find your<br>
Obsession knowledge beckons<br>

In the arms of Morpheus<br>
Drifting away to a place<br>
Where there's more than this<br>
<br>
Blindfolded visionary, eyes lost in the black and bleak<br>
Chasing footsteps in the dark, lost for where they'll lead<br>
Idols and stars shower light on the sublime<br>
Blinding your mind's eye<br>
Bright as your dreams shine<br>
<br>
Blinding your mind's eye<br>
Reclaim your life<br>
<br>
Reclaim your life<br>
From the iron grip of social design<br>
<br>
Reclaim your life<br>
Your cycle around the sun is eclipsing<br>
<br>
Like most of us I was misled into a swarm of noise and distortion<br>
Eroding my deepest thoughts before my inner voice had spoken<br>
To remind me I'm gifted with the power to dream<br>
To see what has never been seen<br>
But I handed it over, consumed by culture<br>
Cloaking the eyes of the visionary<br>
<br>
Comatose<br>
In the arms of Morpheus<br>
Drifting away to a place<br>
Where there's more than this<br>
Hypnosis</p>

            <p class="lyrics-test-test">When nothing could be done<br>
To salvage what was lost<br>
The chosen one<br>
A victim of passion<br>
<br>
He feels the hate rise up<br>
A war that can't be won<br>
The mourning son<br>
Survives through disaster<br>
The soul that suffered<br>
<br>
All that's left behind<br>
Is a memory that fades<br>
Like a rope around your neck<br>
Binds you to a resting place<br>
<br>
And the price that I have paid<br>
When I watched you pass away<br>
Is the everlasting pain<br>
And a memory that fades away<br>
<br>
When all he had was gone<br>
A place we once belonged<br>
The chosen one<br>
Finds an existence<br>
<br>
Second coming life<br>
Daylight pushes on<br>
The mourning son<br>
No longer a victim<br>
<br>
All that's left behind<br>
Is a memory that fades<br>
Like a rope around your neck<br>
Binds you to a resting place<br>
<br>
And the price that I have paid when I watched you pass away<br>
Is the everlasting pain<br>
And a memory that fades away<br>
<br>
The soul that suffered sleeps tonight<br>
In the ashes of his demons<br>
Demons<br>
<br>
Daylight holds no salvation<br>
From this labyrinth of desolation<br>
The fiery hells in his mind<br>
Will burn to the ground in time<br>
<br>
All that's left behind is a memory that fades<br>
Like a rope around your neck<br>
Binds you to a resting place<br>
<br>
And the price that I have paid when I watched you pass away<br>
Is the everlasting pain<br>
And a memory that fades away

Manning the controls of a babbling monkey<br>
The circuits behind the interface can't be seen<br>
So the truth is up to me<br>
Is this life but a dream<br>
<br>
Is reality all my senses perceive?<br>
<br>
It tears me apart from the inside<br>
The story we've accepted<br>
With malleable minds<br>
Dogmatic perceptions designed<br>
In egotistical pride<br>
Have led us blind<br>
<br>
Short of sight<br>
Wondering why our lives feel like they're lacking meaning<br>
We have stopped believing<br>
This is just a ride<br>
<br>
Is reality all my senses perceive?<br>
Is what I touch and I see all that lies in front of me?<br>

We wonder why our lives feel like they're lacking meaning<br>
We've stopped believing<br>

Confusion, illusion, had soaked up her mind<br>
She clutched his hand, whispered her soul,<br>
"I never wanted to grow so old<br>
Life's agony, turn off the machine<br>
Let me leave this world with dignity."<br>
<br>
Just let me leave this world<br>
<br>
Bed of nails under the guillotine<br>
Wake me up when my heart stops beating<br>
When my heart stops beating<br>
<br>
Wipe those tears of grief away young man<br>
Let me leave this world<br>
Let me leave this world in peace<br>
Raise me from this bed of nails<br>
And let the angels carry me away<br>
Away<br>
Carry me away.<br>

Bed of nails under the guillotine<br>
Wake me up when my heart stops beating<br>
When my heart stops beating<br>

Let me leave this world</p>

From his castle in the air of eternal vibration<br>
We won't lose sight of the lasting words he wrote<br>
We won't lose sight of what matters most<br>
<br>
A shining beacon of wisdom<br>
Armed to the teeth fearless conviction<br>
Now that he's gone we're going to miss him<br>
<br>
Immortalised between the lines<br>
Conceived by a human heart inside<br>
<br>
He once said to us, my friend hope is a prison<br>
But the hope his chords sung only spread love<br>
In a hollow crowned kingdom<br>
<br>
There are no fighters left here anymore<br>
See you on the other side of that open door<br>
<br>
We wont lose sight<br>
We wont lose sightv
Of the lasting words he wrote<br>
We won't lose sight of what matters most</p>

Don’t get us wrong though, while we all love a bit of Metallica and still lose our shit every time Hetfield sneezes or Lars manages to keep time, we just feel that there is more to our clan that needs to be celebrated.</p>
