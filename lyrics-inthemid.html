        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Open your eyes as the rivers run red.<br>
Open your eyes as the skies turn black.<br>

Hands to these hardened hearts<br>
and humble those who stand against you.<br>
They will<br>
Know that you are God!<br>
<br>
You are exalted among the nations.<br>
You are exalted in the<br>
Earth, Only you are worthy.<br>
<br>
You speak, yet they do not listen.<br>
They see the signs, but<br>
They heed no warning.<br>
Stretch out your hands to<br>
these hardened hearts and humble<br>
Those who stand against you.<br>
<br>
Open their eyes stretch out<br>
your hand until they can<br>
Understand that you are worthy.<br>
They will know that you are Go.<br>
<br>
Stretch out your<br>
Hands untilthey can understand that you are worthy.<br>
You are wory.<br>
You speak, yet<br>
They do not listen.<br>

They see the signs, but they heed no warning.<br>
Stretch out your<br>
Hands to these hardened hearts<br>
and humble those who stand against you.</p>

        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Oppressed an afflicted,<br>
yet silent he remaine<br>
A lamb led to the slaughter, he kept his mouth shut<br>
My sorrow he carried, for he had none<br>
<br>
His blood rained down on me,<br>
And now it dwells within<br>
Rain down on me!<br>
Rain down on me!<br>
<br>
A perfect creation, we tarnished that name<br>
I am underserving oppressed and afflicted,<br>
yet silent he remianed a lamb<br>
A perfect creation, we tarnished that name<br>
Led to the slaughter, he kept his mouth shut<br>
My sorrow he carried, for he had none<br>
<br>
I give you my life, because of all you gave<br>
I give you my life, because of all you gave<br>
My god, you gave me everything<br>
My god, you gave me everything<br>
<br>
A perfect creation, we tarnished that name<br>
I am underserving<br>
A perfect creation, we tarnished that name<br>
I am underserving<br>
<br>
One for all<br>
We are the underserving<br>
One for all<br>
We deserve death, but you give us life<br>
One for all<br>
We are the underserving<br>
One for all,<br>
We deserve death, but you give us life<br>
<br>
Oppressed and afflicted, yet silent he remained<br>
A lamb led to the slaughter,<br>
he kept his mouth shut!</p>

    <p class="footer-text article-margin">Here at Metal Mashup you will find a site that celebrates all things heavy and metal. Yet in an effort to move away from the more mainstream aspects of our scene, Metal Mashup has a much-needed focus on the more underground achievements of our community. Don’t get us wrong though, while we all love a bit of Metallica and still lose our shit every time Hetfield sneezes or Lars manages to keep time, we just feel that there is more to our clan that needs to be celebrated.</p>
