<br>
Don't give me false hope<br>
This is the darkest that I've ever felt<br>
I never asked so don't assume that I would need your help<br>
Well I'll never fucking need it again<br>
<br>
Now the devil's reaching up to me<br>
I think I feel his hands around my neck<br>
I've never felt this pain<br>
I've never been here before<br>
<br>
Convinced I'll never be the same<br>
You've never lived in my mind<br>
You can't decide what's fair<br>
Now learn your place before I put you there<br>
<br>
I know you're terrified to die, die<br>
Not hard to see by the way you slowly life your life<br>
<br>
I'm still content with everything that I continue to create for myself<br>
You never needed to drag me through the hell<br>
That you've been feeling inside<br>
This is the place that we've been dying to find<br>
<br>
These nights still drag me down<br>
But you will learn your place when I climb out of this hell<br>
If you've been dying inside<br>
This is the place that we've been dying to find<br>
<br>
These nights still drag me down<br>
But I will find my faith when I climb out of this hell<br>
I know I'll never forget<br>
This is the place that I will always regret<br>
<br>
Fuck all the faith I found<br>
So far it's only let me down<br>
I'm doing more with life than you can say for yourself<br>
Fuck all the faith I found<br>
So far it's only let me down<br>
<br>
Patience is never enough<br>
And all you ever do is complain and want for more<br>
<br>
I'm still content with everything that I continue to create for myself<br>
You never needed to drag me through the hell<br>
That you've been feeling inside<br>
This is the place that we've been dying to find<br>
<br>
These nights still drag me down<br>
But you will learn your place when I climb out of this hell<br>
If you've been dying inside<br>
This is the place that we've been dying to find<br>
<br>
These nights still drag me down<br>
But I will find my faith when I climb out of this hell<br>
I know I'll never forget<br>
This is the place that I will always regret<br>
<br>
Save me from hell</p>

I saw the change in your eyes<br>
You're someone else<br>
Must be hard to live with yourself<br>
Just know that we're not wishing you well<br>
Why even put up a fight?<br>
It must be hard to know that<br>
Life was really never on your side<br>
<br>
They tried to tell me how to live<br>
I never bought their bullshit<br>
I watched them pulling you in<br>
I'll draw the line<br>
You crossed it<br>
They tried to tell me how to live<br>
But I was smart enough<br>
To make the choices I did<br>
And have the life that I'd want<br>
<br>
How does it feel to see<br>
The things you want in front of me?<br>
How does it feel to see<br>
The things you want in my hands?<br>
<br>
Give up, you can't hang<br>
So sad to say<br>
Your emotions get in the way<br>
What a fucking waste<br>
We're so sick of all the shit you say<br>
Just shut up<br>
You run your fucking mouth too much<br>
You won't amount to much<br>
So pathetic<br>
Jealously will kill you if you let it<br>

I watched them pulling you in<br>
I'll draw the line<br>
You crossed it<br><br>

They tried to tell me how to live<br>
But I was strong enough to make my own decisions<br>
<br>
This is the last time that you will jump down<br>
My throat about what I've done wrong<br>
I think that you should know<br>
We can do this without you<br>
We're better off without you<br>
<br>
I won't be the one to save you<br>
From the failure that consumes your life<br>
I won't be the one to save you<br>
I was never on your side<br>
<br>
We can do this without you<br>
We're better off without you

Afraid of what we might see<br>

Give me back what fills the void when my minds at the edge<br>
Never thought it'd feel this way<br>
Give me back what these moments all used to mean<br>
Before life got the best of me<br>

Theres still no sign of life here<br>

That the dark has left me for dead<br>
To die alone in the place I called my home<br>

What we're meant to be now<br>
The lies they sold us<br>
Why do we hide<br>
When we're meant to be free<br>
Somehow we bought what they told us<br>
<br>
We're the thorn in your side<br>
Cast the shadow of doubt right out now<br>
We're the thorn in your side<br>
And that crown you wear is rusting out now<br>
<br>
We're the thorn in your side<br>
There's comfort in a darker sky<br>
We're the thorn in your side<br>
Not letting go until I know why you were sent to die<br>
We're the thorn in your side<br>
<br>
Nothing but blood<br>
Can change what you have done<br>
I've bled myself enough for you<br>
The holy one</p>

        <p class="lyrics-test-test">[feat. Ahren Stringer Of The Amity Affliction]<br>
<br>
Buried my skeletons inside the darkest part of my thoughts<br>
Cut out the bones and left a space for the light to shine on<br>
Stitched up the seams when I felt overgrown<br>
Cut out the bones that made it hard for me to stand on my own<br>
<br>
I carry my mistakes and never let them define me<br>
I will walk alone but I won't follow blindly<br>
<br>
Do you dream our lives could be so different<br>
From this hell we live in<br>
Now it seems<br>
This life has killed the dream that I've dreamed<br>
I never meant to leave you all behind<br>
But nothing good lasts forever<br>
I never meant to leave you in the past<br>
But nothing good will ever last<br>
<br>
Skeletons became the only thing that I could trust<br>
Cut out the bones and left a space for collecting dust<br>
Stitched up the seems finally let go<br>
Cut out the bones when I felt fucking alone<br>
<br>
Remove whats left in my chest<br>
In every good life there is an image of death<br>
<br>
I carry my mistakes and never let them define me<br>
I will walk alone but I won't follow blindly<br>
<br>
Do you dream our lives could be so different<br>
From this hell we live in<br>
Now it seems<br>
This life has killed the dream that I've dreamed<br>
I never meant to leave you all behind<br>
But nothing good lasts forever<br>
I never meant to leave you in the past<br>
But nothing good will ever last<br>
<br>
Remove whats left in my chest<br>
In every good life there is an image of death

Never someone I’ll defend<br><br>
Could’ve been should’ve been<br>
You say it was never supposed to be this way<br>
Built up to come crashing down with your namev
Could’ve been should’ve been<br>

Return to dust the same way that you came<br>
You should know better than anyone<br>
The past can never be undone<br>
Blank stares from the people you once knew<br>
Your downfall is overdue<br>
You’re no king<br><br>
A broken crown sits at your feet<br>
Pieces of what you used to be<br>
You only see what you want to see<br>
You become transparent when you’re held to the light<br>
I think it’s time you learn to take loss in stride and walk away from what’s mine<br>
Rock bottom and you’re falling faster every day<br>
You’ll find no compassion<br><br>
You’ll find no sympathy<br>
Return to dust the same way that you came<br>

What would it take to change my expiration date?<br>
Sick of borrowing time I will never repay.<br>

There's an art to losing every single thing you love.<br>
Where do you turn when all you're left with is bad blood?<br>
<br>
Is this what it's like, to be put back on the shelf?<br>
Left to collect the dust of someone else.<br>
The light in the back of the tunnel quickly fades to black.<br>
Seasons change as I'm left in the past.<br>
<br>
There's no home sweet home when you're sinking underneath just like a stone.<br>
Sinking down, sinking down alone.<br>
There's no home sweet home.<br>
<br>
Nothing left to believe in.<br>
Everything I know is slipping away.<br>
Right down the drain.<br>
Is this all in vain?<br>
<br>
Nothing left to fight for.<br>
Every new chance brought another door, slammed in my face.<br>
Yet I still came back for more.<br>
<br>
Too stubborn to swallow my pride.<br>
Afraid to admit that I've been set aside.<br>
Taken out of the limelight.<br>

Why even bother with a world that pulls me down when I'm sinking?<br>
What I'd give to be naive<br>
The only way I can feel is to disconnect myself from everything<br>
If you can't come to terms with the life that I choose to lead<br>
Stay the fuck away from me<br>
If you can't come to terms with the life I choose to lead<br>
Stay away from me<br>

I won't get stuck on looking back<br>
We're all so guilty of wanting what we'll never have<br>
Fight fire with fire, there is no desire in me<br>
To be like anything you want to see<br>
I'll write you off, write it all off<br>
No second thoughts<br>
You can trace the lines to connect the dots<br>
Write you off, write it all off<br>
No second thoughts<br>
You can trace the lines to connect the dots<br>

Nothing gold can stay<br>
Every breath you take will bring you closer to your dying day<br>
Too much time to contemplate the black and white<br>
I refuse to sell my soul for a place to die<br>
<br>
I don't owe the world a god damn thing<br>
I don't owe the world a god damn thing<br>
I don't owe the world a single thing<br>
And I won't get stuck on looking back<br>
I won't get stuck<br>

I won't get stuck on looking back<br>
We're all so guilty of wanting what we'll never have<br>

There’s no truth that will give me peace of mind<br>

Just know that there will be no song of grace to lead you in<br>
No holy water that will rid you of your sins<br>
There will be no light to pull you from the dark side<br>
Left to decay inside your own lies<br>

In this weightless state I’ve become so empty<br>

The damage is already done, but the worst is yet to be seen<br>
No wishful thinking<br>
A slate that can’t be wiped clean<br>
Here and now is all we know<br>
Until we’re forced to let go,<br>
I’d give it up to find a new home<br>
A place that I can call my own<br>

We’re told to walk along a thin line<br>
Can’t fall out of place<br>

History repeats the same routine again<br>

It’s hard to live with yourself when neither side can be pleased<br>

Learned to love the misery and lack of company that death is promising me<br>
Learned to love the misery and all of the tragedy that death is promising me<br>

Force fed to believe there’s something more for me<br>
Set up to fail with no chance to succeed<br>

Wasted days spent watching my life pass by<br>
Take me away<br>
Back to a better time where I’m not standing in line ready to die<br>
I know I’ve been here before, questioning everything<br>
Left with my heart on the floor<br>

Kick me when I’m down<br>
Numb to the pain<br>

Just pull the chair from underneath my feet<br>

To say a prayer would mean I had some faith<br>
But I guess distance got the best of me<br>

Memories we can’t erase<br>

Good things never come; I give up<br>
Grown to love not being enough<br>
Remove me from the frame<br>
A picture that was meant to fade away<br>
Wither away to grey<br>

To say a prayer would mean there’s a glimpse of hope in me<br>
That’s something that I’ve never seen,<br>
