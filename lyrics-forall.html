to this vacant room that i’ve been sitting in.<br>
Scratching at the walls, imprisoned in this state of mind.<br>
Brought into life with no hope in sight.<br>
Scratching at the walls of my new found home,<br><br>
the paint sits deep under my nails,<br>
A constant reminder of the attempts i've made,<br>
To escape from this place, to free myself from pain.<br>
To loosen these chains.<br>
To escape from this place, to free myself from pain,<br>
To rid my heart of hate. Rid my life of hate.<br>
My mind, an empty room with no windows to see through.<br>
Isolated from the truth(from the truth).<br>
Do my eyes deceive me by what they have not seen,<br>
Freedom, the one desire that will never cease.<br><br>
There must be more to this life of mine.<br>
There is something deep inside that testifies of a greater kind.<br>
I cannot simply reach out for something better.<br>
I sit here incapable of such a feat,<br>
predetermined defeat,<br>
Unable to see past these walls around me.<br><br>
My mind, an empty room with no windows to see through.<br>

I’m a broken man,<br>
I find no purpose in these hands, I can’t build anything for myself.<br>
They have left me,<br>
with no guideline or outline of what or who I am meant to be.<br>
Everythings unclear(everything that I see here),<br>

Im just a broken man,<br>
gripping to life with a broken hand.<br><br>
I wish, I had the strength to live a life,<br>
a life free of regret.<br>
All these thoughts running through my head,<br>
in my own strength,<br>
I think i'd just wind up dead.<br><br>
Lend me a helping hand, someone teach me to be a better man.<br>
It’s like i've heard it all before.<br>
Give me a reason to breath or I won’t breath at all.<br>
Living through all this pain,<br>
living amongst this hate, I cant bear another day.<br><br>
What could I do, what could I say,<br>
that could make this pain go away,<br>
What could I do, what could I say,<br><br>
 cant bear another day, and it’s eating me away.<br>
I am alone and cold, hopeless and broken and wretched with no place to go.<br>
I am alone and cold, in desperate need of a purpose and a chance of hope.<br>

The little hope we have, is wasting away.<br>
The little hope we have, is wasting away, day after day.<br>

So follow me to the surface,<br>
take a chance, take a breath, and follow me.<br>
Would you rather be, the nameless, the faceless,<br>
the lifeless, a man with no eyes to see.<br><br>
Would you dare stray from the wide path to see what you could become.<br>
Would you dare.<br>
Seek out truth, with your whole heart & it will find you.<br>
Seek out truth, with your whole heart & it will find you.<br>
There is no mistake to be made,<br>
He will find you, there is no mistake to be made.<br><br>

Would you dare to become all that you were made to be.<br>
Would you dare stray from the wide path to see.<br>
I see past all the haze,<br>

All they say they claim to be true.<br>
Pull me closer to you.<br>

The enemy paints these skies with lies to keep me off this floor.<br>
Their persuasive ways have tricked me before.<br>

Help to keep me, firmly on the ground,<br>

I still struggle, my life is on the line.<br>
So now I walk in this shadow,<br>
a few steps from the light.<br>
I am so close to the decision that will change my life.<br>
On the edge, I see my future out in front of me.<br>
The only thing in my way is all I used to be.<br>
Stand down, step aside,<br>
my wicked mind and my pride.<br><br>
I’m done with you.<br>
Take, take it all upon yourself.<br>
To the man I was, to the man ive been, you are dead to me,<br>
and I am dead to you.<br>
So now I walk in freedom, and I see where i’ve been.<br>
This heart, in my chest has been washed clean.<br>
Now I am new,<br>

If only you were standing right in front of me<br>
<br>
I hate this separation, this is not where I'm meant to be<br>
We must be together, there's nothing else that this world can offer me<br>
But I wont give up, and I wont give in.<br>
Can you hear the sound<br>
<br>
There's no sweeter sound than the footsteps of the Almighty<br>
Coming to find me, coming to bring me home<br>
<br>
Come find us, here we are.<br>
Sitting and hoping and seeking your love to overflow<br>
Because I owe everything that I am to you,<br>
And everything I have belongs to your kingdom<br>
I must bare the truth<br>
Can you hear the sound?<br>
<br>
There's no sweeter sound than the footsteps of the Almighty<br>
Coming to find me, coming to bring me home<br>
There's no sweeter sound<br>

I can hear the footsteps,<br>
I can hear him coming<br>
I can hear the footsteps<br>
I can hear him coming<br>

To take us home.<br>

        <h1 id="s8" class="lyrics-test">-Stitched The Same-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">[feat. Kyle Tamosaitis]<br>
<br>
These words have shaped me to this day<br>
Directed me to the path I now take.<br>
"You have encouraged me to lead the life I always wanted to lead"<br>
I want to be the inspiration that they need<br>
There is no difference between you and me.<br>
<br>
Are we all woven together?<br>
Are we all tied in knots, because I know I'm this way?<br>
Don't you feel the same?<br>
<br>
Meet me half way, I'll take the stage you take the clay.<br>
Such a humble exchange, we all find home in this place.<br>
<br>
I hope you find what you are looking for.<br>
But if you doubt, don't be ashamed.<br>
Because we're all woven together, and tonight we're stitched the same.<br>
<br>
Tonight we're stitched the same<br>
I'm just the same as you, all my struggles and mistakes.<br>
So let's hold each other up, because we know we've been made this way.<br>
<br>
Cos we're all woven together<br>
And tonight we're stitched the same.

        <h1 id="s9" class="lyrics-test">-White Flame-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">I have overcome<br>
Every wall, every inch of myself<br>
With no hold on the ways of this world<br>
I have conquered my inmost defeat<br>
Now death lays dying before my own two feet<br>
Our path was always meant to meet<br>
<br>
Maybe not now but soon you'll see.<br>
<br>
This white-hot flame inside of me<br>
Will scorch the earth<br>
And everything that stands in my way.<br>
Overcome!<br>
<br>
I am no mortal<br>
As long as this spark is within me<br>
Is within me<br>
<br>
As it engulfs me<br>
It changes everything<br>
My soul is on fire for reasons<br>
Made certain by desires found in me<br>
<br>
But what choice did I have?<br>
But what choice did I have?<br>
<br>
They engraved my back<br>
With this detailed map,<br>
Showing the plan<br>
That I should outlast<br>
<br>
I can feel it burning under my flesh<br>
This feeling has averted me to this very second<br>
This moment means everything<br>
I have come to life<br>
Life<br>
<br>
As it engulfs me<br>
It changes everything<br>
My soul is on fire for reasons<br>
Made certain by desires found in me<br>
<br>
My eyes are burning<br>
My eyes are burning<br>
My eyes are burning<br>
My eyes are burning with desire<br>
<br>
Scorch the earth<br>
Scorch the earth<br>
<br>
We have overcome<br>
We have overcome<br>
We have overcome<br>
<br>
The white flame burns in me

        <h1 id="s10" class="lyrics-test">-Awaken The Heart-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">I remember the words You said to me<br>
They still ring true as if You said them yesterday<br>
Giving up is never an option<br>
You may find it hard but they have forgotten<br>
The love they have left is never far from them<br>
<br>
Though this world has turned cold<br>
I'll let the warmth embrace me<br>
And lead me on my way home<br>
Through these streets I roam, thinking all along<br>
<br>
Awaken the heart<br>
We have numbed ourselves to the concept of love<br>
We have forgotten how to truly embrace how to face each day<br>
I have given all of myself to bridge the gap between heaven & hell<br>
All coming in none going out stolen from the grips of the reaper himself<br>
I foresee pointing fingers and accusations aimed at me<br>
Our methods may not be of ease<br>
But we're spreading His love with our arms outreached<br>
<br>
Though this world has turned cold<br>
I'll let the warmth embrace me and lead me on my way home<br>
Through these streets I roam, thinking all along<br>
How can they not know?<br>
How can they not know?<br>
<br>
There's a void in us all, waiting to be made full.<br>
We have numbed ourselves to the concept of love<br>
We have forgotten what it means to say, “I'm alive and well today”<br>
<br>
I know I will never be alone<br>
His loving reach stretches past the farthest place that I can go<br>
<br>
I will never be alone<br>
Assured to me by the love He has shown<br>
I will never be the same<br>
My home is found in His embrace<br>
<br>
Our goal is reached by showing love and compassion to those we meet<br>
An entire world at peace<br>
Covered by grace and completely set free<br>
Our home is found in His eternal embrace

          <h1 id="t1" class="lyrics-test">-Shadow-</h1>
          <p class="lyrics-test-test">Can a broken man speak whole words?<br>
Can hope be taught from a place of hurt?<br>
Can love exist in a world of hate?<br>
Can truth outlast even the faintest of faith?<br>
<br>
Will I ever know?<br>
<br>
I can feel there's a devil in me refusing to leave.<br>
My life didn't end, it never began.<br>
There's a thorn in me that won't leave me be.<br>
<br>
So when my last breath fails and I start to go,<br>
Will I figure out what's been binding up my heart?<br>
We can't go back to where it began.<br>
The hardest times are the times we're living in.<br>
Right now.<br>
<br>
We are the shadow.</p>

          <h1 id="t2" class="lyrics-test">-Fallout-</h1>
          <p class="lyrics-test-test">Inhale, inhale, life leaves as smoke prevails<br>
These walls weep as my will to live simply fails<br>
Inhale, inhale, few words remain in the wake of betrayal<br>
I've felt every stone and every nail<br>
<br>
You said this world was behind us<br>
You used these words to define us<br>
<br>
With every chance to pull back your hand<br>
You sparked the match, you sparked the match<br>
You sparked the match and let us burn<br>
<br>
I'm standing in this house, burning down<br>
Was it worth it, was it worth it<br>
Twisting home into my own hell?<br>
<br>
I'll never find my own sense of self<br>
In another person, I've been far too complacent<br>
So now I know my whole world is flammable<br>
<br>
Inhale, inhale, it's coming down and I'm not so certain<br>
There's something wrong here<br>
Inhale, inhale, confining walls are built to burn<br>
Oh, this is a place I hope to never return<br>
<br>
Watch me tear this wall of fire open<br>
And crawl from the furnace our love once sculpted<br>
From the inside I was blinded<br>
Broader vision helps to define it, you can't deny this<br>
<br>
You said this world was behind us<br>
You used these words to define us<br>
No matter your intention<br>
All you ever did was confine us<br>
<br>
I feel the air<br>
I feel the air<br>
<br>
For the first time in years<br>
For the first time in years, I feel the air<br>
For the first time in years, I feel the air</p>

          <h1 id="t3" class="lyrics-test">-Nightmare-</h1>
          <p class="lyrics-test-test">This is the sound of my certain self being unwound.<br>
I sink deeper and deeper into hell, a hollow shell entering a new realm.<br>
Inside my mind, captive to a new Reich.<br>
<br>
So this is what it sounds like?<br>
This is what it sounds like.<br>
Hell.<br>
It's all around.<br>
Hell.<br>
So this is what it sounds like.<br>
Failure to prevail. Trapped in my own cell, living in my own hell.<br>
What is worth discerning through all this hurting?<br>
This is truly concerning.<br>
I've seen hell and home blur together.<br>
Am I a man or a monster?<br>
Am I a man or a monster?<br>
I can feel it now.<br>
No returning back through all this hurting.<br>
The deep and dark has swallowed me up.<br>
There's no describing what I have become.<br>
<br>
Must I destroy myself to see the good prevail?<br>
I was certain of who I was, but now I'm certain that it's all lost.<br>
Seems so much harder now, to keep my feet on the ground.<br>
I don't belong here, trapped in this nightmare.<br>
Pick me up, pull me out from this place that has me bound<br>
I don't belong here, trapped in this nightmare.<br>
This is my life unwound and this is how it sounds.<br>
This is how it sounds.<br>
This is how it sounds.<br>
Will I ever exist again, with my own heart within my own skin?<br>
Can you feel it now?</p>

          <h1 id="t4" class="lyrics-test">-The Will-</h1>
          <p class="lyrics-test-test">Pieces of me are scattered too far to see.<br>
Pain ends they say, but it refuses to leave.<br>
I have the will in me, but at times I refuse to believe.<br>
I may seem whole, but I'm missing a crucial piece.<br>
My reality is the hardest truth to instill.<br>
I'm in pieces, I'm in pieces.<br>
Slowly finding the will to rebuild.</p>

          <h1 id="t5" class="lyrics-test">-September-</h1>
          <p class="lyrics-test-test">I'm searching for the right words to say,<br>
yet they all escape.<br>
Nothing deciphers what happened to me on this day.<br>
My love lay waste as my life is disgraced.<br>
All clarity is slowly decayed.<br>
<br>
Hopeless men carry broken hearts, weighed down by hurtful words.<br>
All I have is living in the past. I can't help but reflect.<br>
I recollect; once holding your hand,<br>
Not looking forward never looking back.<br>
Nothing in that moment lacked.<br>
Though now we're apart,<br>
I can't seem to restart.<br>
Emptiness is all I have.<br>
We were so madly in love,<br>
So much so that we could never be apart.<br>
We had the whole world out in front,<br>
Oh the tears I've shed knowing now that you're gone.<br>
<br>
I hope I never remember, the darkest day of September.<br>
<br>
Oh, for seven long years I built and you brought it down.<br>
Oh, for seven long years I bled and it meant nothing to you.<br>
<br>
How will I ever find the will, the will to rebuild.<br>
How will I ever find the will to rebuild without you.</p>

          <h1 id="t6" class="lyrics-test">-The Vacated-</h1>
          <p class="lyrics-test-test">As the wind blows, hope from sorrow<br>
This place we used to call our home leaves me cold as stone<br>
<br>
The voice of the vacated is still present<br>
<br>
In a way it has never left<br>
I wish the pain away but it holds in my skin<br>
Old wounds are the words I have left unsaid<br>
The pain behind these eyes is the kind you don't forget<br>
<br>
You've taken everything, more of me that anyone ever has<br>
Now I'm taking it all back, taking it back<br>
<br>
We were tethered, you and I<br>
Tangled up in a lie, intertwined<br>
We were tethered, held together<br>
I may seem free but I'm lost behind your eyes<br>
<br>
Pain is shaping who I am<br>
Time is taking me away from this<br>
When I arrive, survived and determined<br>
I can rebuild with the pieces that remain untaken<br>
<br>
I may be broken and hurting in this place you left<br>
Place you left<br>
But in a flicker, this will be a memory<br>
Years in the past<br>
<br>
Hold on, hold on, hold on<br>
These words will soon be gone<br>
<br>
My heart refuses to restart<br>
It once beat in time with yours<br>
Our eyes lock and I remember what we've lost<br>
<br>
Across this barren plane, staring you in the face<br>
I'll say it again as I've said it before<br>
These scars are the same as yours<br>
<br>
As the wind blows, hope from sorrow<br>
This place we used to call our home leaves me cold as stone</p>

          <h1 id="t8" class="lyrics-test">-Ascendant-</h1>
          <p class="lyrics-test-test">I've been pulled back, from the jaws of death.<br>
The knife moves slow through skin on bone.<br>
<br>
Time I had to myself in my head on my own,<br>
Almost severed the light of life I've always known.<br>
No second chances, none for granted.<br>
These two feet are planted.<br>
Through the heart of the moment somehow I'm still standing.<br>
<br>
I know I'm stronger than I've ever been.<br>
For what its worth, through all this hurt, I'm still standing now.<br>
Claws draw light from the hole in my soul, how don't they understand.<br>
I'm more than a man.<br>
<br>
Ascendant.<br>
<br>
I am alive, take a look inside.<br>
Every ounce of me fights to survive.<br>
All that I've said and done doesn't matter.<br>
This war is won.<br>
<br>
Drowned out by thoughts of the past, none of it matters, nothing ever lasts.<br>
I count myself blessed to be free from the grips of heresy.<br>
<br>
I know I'm stronger than I've ever been.<br>
For what it's worth, through all this hurt, I'm still standing now.<br>
For what it's worth, through all this hurt.<br>
I know nothing can break me, nothing can break my skin.<br>
They'll see I'm still standing now.<br>
<br>
Claws draw me back to the hell I've known.<br>
Claws draw me back to the edge of death.<br>
They mustn't know I am, ascendant.<br>
<br>
Ascendant.</p>

          <h1 id="t9" class="lyrics-test">-Vivid-</h1>
          <p class="lyrics-test-test">Light still bleeds in through the window,<br>
I lay faintly awake.<br>
A gentle warmth is present as I discern my thoughts from my dreams.<br>
I've been here for weeks with only few winks of sleep.<br>
The tears keep flowing and flowing.<br>
The pain keeps growing and growing, to no end.<br>
My mind now knows what my body refuses to believe.<br>
The worst part of losing you, I know I've lost me too.<br>
<br>
I've been here for weeks, with only few winks of sleep.<br>
Our love once alight, is now lost to the night.<br>
The tears keep flowing and flowing.<br>
The pain keeps growing and growing.</p>

          <h1 id="t10" class="lyrics-test">-Derailed-</h1>
          <p class="lyrics-test-test">Could your life pour out<br>
through the chip in the glass?<br>
Could you hold regret as your time slips past?<br>
If it doesn't hurt then what's it worth?<br>
<br>
That's why I remain within the pain<br>
Nothing is lost and no one is to blame<br>
That's why I remain within the pain<br>
Afraid to feel? Be afraid to slip away<br>
<br>
Granting yourself no escape, counting every single day<br>
Comfort is the road to a life left to waste<br>
Contentment is the freight train to decay<br>
<br>
That's why I remain within the pain<br>
Nothing is lost and no one is to blame<br>
That's why I remain within the pain<br>
Afraid to feel? Be afraid to slip away<br>
<br>
Be afraid, all you love will lead you astray<br>
Be afraid, be afraid to slowly decay<br>
<br>
Far too much time I've spent hidden away<br>
Holding my breath in just to feel okay<br>
I feel my heart is far too far away<br>
Life left me lost, it's only me to blame<br>
<br>
How far must I fall<br>
Before I feel some self-remorse?<br>
How far, must I go<br>
Before I find my way back home?<br>
<br>
On the tilt of time, on the brink of life<br>
On the edge of night, purpose looms in the light<br>
<br>
Don't be afraid, you're safe<br>
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid<br>

How far must I fall?<br>
How far must I go?<br>
<br>
How far must I go?

          <h1 id="t11" class="lyrics-test">-Clearer-</h1>
          <p class="lyrics-test-test">Drowning in every word you've said to me.<br>
Realising the tide is swallowing me.<br>
I can't breathe, I can't breathe.<br>
My visions blurred though I clearly see.<br>
<br>
Is it clearer?<br>
The way in which you left me.<br>
The hope I hold for life itself is locked away.<br>
Is it clearer?<br>
How easily you broke me.<br>
You've had my heart all along.<br>
You hold the key.<br>
What you've said and done can never be forgotten.<br>
Cos my trust is lost and my love is gone,<br>
I don't feel I can ever move on.<br>
<br>
From a lie to a lie to a lie to a lie, just to get you by.<br>
From a lie to a lie to a lie to a lie, just to get you by.<br>
The place I want to be I can never go.<br>
The waves of suffering are crashing so slow.<br>
So slow.<br>
<br>
Is it clearer?<br>
The way in which you left me.<br>
The hope I hold for life itself is locked away.<br>
<br>
Is it clearer?<br>
How easily you broke me.<br>
You've had my heart all along.<br>
You hold the key.<br>
I'm waiting for the hands that mend.<br>
I'm waiting for the hands that mend, to make me whole again.<br>
To make me whole again.<br>
Is it clearer?</p>
