      <h1 id="f1" class="lyrics-test">-Unfurling A Darkened Gospel-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">Propel this solitary man in front of us with<br>
his corrupted global agenda muttering into his ears<br>
Corporate money stuffed into his pockets<br>
to spread his darkened gospel<br><br>
In the past the crowned once held the covenant<br>
to shape and develop a better world<br>
Their influence and supremacy built by<br>
generating optimistic and confident perception<br>
offerings to their herds of sheep<br>
Time repeats itself and outspoken pledges<br>
continue to not succeed, the people have<br>
renounced trust in ideologies<br>
Safety and protection is the contemporary<br><br>
vow for the role that will reinstall masterdom and control<br>
To rescue us from uncertainty and peril<br>
that we are visionless to see or interpret<br>
A threat that evidently needs to be fought<br>
in a manufactured, waged war<br>
A vile misconception that has unfurled<br>
unquestioned while being exaggerated and disfigured</p>

      <h1 id="f2" class="lyrics-test">-Summon The Hounds-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">Summon the servants<br>
that are chained at the throat by a tarnished<br>
chain only devoted to their prosperous fathers<br>
A grip so tight it bruises the neck when the beast<br>
exhales the horror's that settle internally<br>
Galloping toward immoral intent with the set<br>
bounties on the heads of the righteous<br><br>
The dismantled bodies given back for validation<br>
and gratuity to amuse the gods of fortune<br>
The itching appetite grows as these hounds<br>
unearth the leaders and thieve on the lives of the weak beneath them<br>
Aggravation dissolves into a joyous laughter<br>
as the oppressors loan vows to benefit the wealthy<br>
And cast down the frail hero<br>
by hero slaughtered in vain, assassinations<br>
of demigods in secrecy<br>
A never ending pattern to cast down the frail and throne the elite</p>

      <h1 id="f3" class="lyrics-test">-Constitutional Masturbation-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">Taken by the benumbed hands<br>
of an overthrowing, fabricated God.<br>
Sadism is fashioned to derive pleasurable<br>
and gratifying entertainment among indoctrinated soldiers.<br>
Sexually abusive torture is diminished to mere wretched amusement.<br>
Ordered to fragment the sanity of prisoners<br>
of an artificial war amidst a country of dystopia.<br><br>
The blameless are left in complete shackled<br>
isolation left to linger and ultimately wither and rot.<br>
Fraudulent peacemakers withdraw any sense<br>
of morality to plant the seeds of their own sadistic conceptions.<br>
This fabricated God reduces man to nothing<br>
more than a pile of waste.<br>
With this power he banishes his followers<br>
and sentences them to his own personal sins.<br><br>
He masturbates on the scriptures that hold<br>
his kingdom together as one and lays it to shame.
</p>

      <h1 id="f4" class="lyrics-test">-Regurgitated Disinformation-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">Falsehood projects from a<br>
day-to-day instrumental broadcast that<br>
flows through the net of mass media<br>
The lungs swell as the puppets speak<br><br>
to the public as their words grow limbs<br>
to crawl and give birth to ignorance<br>
Reports endlessly drift and clock reality<br>
leaving mass audiences to believe into layers of fiction<br>
The hellish elite pull the vulnerable<br>
strings of journalism with the mastery<br>
of everyday blood money and ultimatums<br><br>
The boundless flavor of dominance on the<br>
starved tongue gives these kings a mental state of ambitious arousal<br>
For corruption steadily trickles from<br>
their fingertips and showers into the<br>
pool of forged mental assurance at their feet<br>
The sleeping masses live on in their so<br>
called tranquil lifestyle, they sleep and wake utterly<br><br>
Blindfolded in a regurgitated fashion money<br>
will always equal dominance, above law and above<br>
Government disinformation will<br>
constantly leave a nation as a forever<br>
Sleeping giant due to the ongoing voice of propaganda</p>

      <h1 id="f5" class="lyrics-test">-March To Global Enslavement-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">Epidemic once again uncovers<br>
its malignant crown in one instantaneous instant<br>
A man made formula hatches out of its shell<br>
to inch closer to suppress the living and breathing<br>
The newborn are nurtured in a world of a dishonest master design<br><br>
A layout constructed only for the purpose<br>
f dominance, authority and power<br>
Born as slaves into bondage, born into<br>
a prison that they can't distinguish with smell or touch<br>
In a world that's been fallaciously influenced for decades<br>
Where the ones who offer solution are<br>
ecretively the core of this ongoing problem<br>
Architects of control build their herds<br>
of municipal infantry with inventions of fear and panic<br><br>
We all march quietly with open hands into global enslavement<br>
Drown us, submerge our bodies in the ocean of manipulation</p>

      <h1 id="f6" class="lyrics-test">-Butchering The Enlightened-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">This nation is forcefully shackled<br>
to the fatigued earth it endeavors standing on.<br>
Ruled and overthrown by tyranny and dictatorship<br>
weakening it at its delicate knees.<br>
Liberation is a fabricated expression only<br>
uttered by the propagandized swarm of illogical followers.<br>
Men, woman and children all blindfolded and<br>
mislead to believe in a world of utter persuasion.<br><br>
Striking terror in the eyes of the ignorant<br>
with public displays of manslaughter and execution grounds<br>
To butcher the enlightened for what purpose?<br>
Because starvation for power mushrooms<br><br>
upward leaving leaders foaming<br>
Across their malnourished, gaping jaws.<br>
Striking their iron hammers to fuck over the breathing bodies slaving<br>
To conform to a lie build the gates to<br>
close the doorway from truth, slam the doors on reality.</p>

      <h1 id="f7" class="lyrics-test">-Lords Of Chaos-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">The blameless are succumbing<br>
to the ravages of warfare built upon capital and greed<br>
The lords of corruption leave their people to rot<br>
in the gore-riddened streets of chaos<br>
Education, employment and health, all stolen<br>
from the hands that deteriorate at the flesh<br>
The slaving clench their fists pleading and<br><br>
praying for a redesigned future as they reach<br>
the brink of renouncement<br><br>
Dreading to open the mouth and spill the<br>
words of loathing for with this tongue will only bring execution<br>
Hundreds upon thousands all damned at<br>
the dawning of life,<br>
all damned at the opening day of birth<br><br>
The manufactured gods detach these<br>
withered bodies and sell the<br>
Land to the highest bidder of the corporate elite<br>
With death comes revenue,<br>
piles of profit and wealth all generated in blood.
</p>

      <h1 id="f8" class="lyrics-test">-Psychological Immorality-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">It began under the dictatorship<br>
of a dark lord with the mindset of<br>
world supremacy set in years past<br>
Our nation picked up the pieces<br>
of a slain giant and continued to<br>
shape a psychological immorality<br>
Mind control on mass scale in post war endeavors,<br><br>
a shameful instrument once used to take over the deteriorating world<br>
Unspeakable experiments cast on the on the blameless<br>
with no justification or rational reasoning<br>
Deprivation of food, withering the helpless into fading,<br>
cadaverous bodies corroding at the mouth<br>
Forced sleeplessness, causing the brain to malfunction<br><br>
and shut down, leaving the patients to fall into mental illness<br>
Immense shock treatment and drug intake<br>
injected at the vein to degrade the human<br>
body and its weakening organs<br>
Blackening all luminescence to puzzle the<br>
mind to create dread of the time that lay ahead<br>
A discharged invasion of the mind, a program now Americanized</p>

      <h1 id="f9" class="lyrics-test">-To Detonate And Exterminate-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">The bodies of millions pile<br>
atop the splintered streets of a now rotting metropolis.<br>
Ignorantly drowning in the flames<br>
and fumes fabricated by their own doing.<br>
As their lives smolder and ignite their<br><br>
faces steadily ripen with immense pleasure.<br>
Self-execution comes with victory,<br>
self-mutilation comes with utter success.<br>
Their perception flickers within<br>
the glowing and ignited landscape<br>
as they gaze toward the once populated soil.<br>
The nations flag cloaks the impure<br><br>
fallen militant bodies, fraudulent celebration of integrity.<br>
The hordes of the serpentine lord<br>
infantry march and butcher the remaining living.<br>
Nuclear warfare ticks down as the<br>
sirens resonate through the ears of the moribund.<br>
Detonation! Extermination!<br>
The fragmented shell diffuses and erupts<br>
A conflagration of infernal horror</p>

      <h1 id="f10" class="lyrics-test">-Ruination-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">The earth slowly rots into a malignant tumor,<br>
Breeding no life for the future of the world<br>
In wake of a nuclear war bodies rise from the<br>
fractured and decomposing fields of abandonment.<br><br>
Their bodies and faces mutated and disfigured,<br>
Still breathing through their brimful lungs<br>
They limp and crawl across the ruins they<br><br>
once claimed on a leisurely ongoing march.<br>
Their flesh still burns, the skin blackens<br>
And embers into the dimming air.

          <p class="lyrics-test-test">I've come to an implausible conclusion<br>
That I'm bathing my hands with a refreshment of poison<br>
I'm indulging my thirstiness with an infectious substance<br>
For the bane of my existence is solely outlined to aid the<br>
breeding of ill and brainless<br>
Lather, rinse, repeat<br><br>
Gather, convince, deceit<br>
A global shift has commenced one gallon at a time<br>
Turning the masses into walking malignancies<br>
Imbecilic livestock with their numbers on the decline<br>
A world is carved from blameless blood<br>
Carving miles of trenches deep into the intellect of man
</p>

          <h1 id="t6" class="lyrics-test">-The Celestial Antidote-</h1>
          <p class="lyrics-test-test">I have found my face gnawing<br>
way at my own existence again<br>
It's feeding and medication on the ballooning hunger for a formulated religion<br>
For my Lord comes in a tiny capsulated form<br>
Restore prayers with inebriation - my dependency<br><br>
A substance helping me string<br><br>
And I must carefully weave my life in a destructive, spiraling transcendency<br>
These divine elements shine a light so radiant when synthesized<br>
A celestial antidote to cure all<br>
A heavenly impurity to alter what we know as God
</p>

          <h1 id="t7" class="lyrics-test">-Encircled By Mirrors-</h1>
          <p class="lyrics-test-test">We socialize in the moonless pit<br>
Of my own intelligence<br>
<br>
I'm suspended in space<br>
And encircled by mirrors<br>
<br>
Through my reflection<br>
Things are becoming clearer<br>
Apparently teeth<br>
Are beginning to germinate from the roots of my eyes<br>
<br>
I find myself wincing<br>
As they chew through my optic flesh<br>
<br>
Layers of teeth<br>
Dancing, waltzing<br>
Their way out of my now punctured face<br>
<br>
It's comical in retrospect<br>
I used to enjoy this<br>
Levitating notion of escape<br>

It's opening the gates<br>
To a newborn philosophy<br>

My deep seeded dementia embraced<br>

Layers of teeth<br>
Dancing, waltzing<br>
Their way out of my now punctured face<br>
<br>
My deep seeded dementia embraced<br>
<br>

Hallucinogenic contemplations<br>
Have become my finest friend<br>
<br>
It's opening the gates<br>
To a newborn philosophy<br>
My deep seeded dementia embraced</p>

          <h1 id="t8" class="lyrics-test">-Buried Monuments-</h1>
          <p class="lyrics-test-test">I recognize a blueprint for<br>
madmen has been inked<br>
Inked within the skin of myself<br>
They've planted seeds and have been sewn into buried monuments<br>
They're entombed doomsday vaults resembling monstrous coffins<br>
A mind bending experimentation to reshape my everyday consumption<br><br>
they can see through the cracks<br>
To inject the soil in which I stand<br>
It perverts that of which I bloom<br><br>
Disease slumbers within the earth<br>
Blooming gardens of slaughter
</p>

          <h1 id="t9" class="lyrics-test">-Worming Nightfall-</h1>
          <p class="lyrics-test-test">A landscape of mountains<br>
and filth floods my perspective<br>
Nightfall worms its way, mutating the<br>
air into a black mass of secrets<br>
It's alluring as I stand on the summit<br>
of self-destruction in all of its brilliance<br><br>
I have a panoramic view of my prodigal<br>
fate with a nose dive out of existence<br>
My untouched eyelids unlock in a<br>
pineal gland trance of blasphemy<br><br>
My cerebral matter synthesizes a<br>
sharpened warmth forming a kaleidoscopic ecstasy<br>
A fond farewell decent morphs to a<br>
 tairwell of a hallucinogenic world<br>
Lost in a sea of illusions and alternate reality</p>

          <p class="footer-text article-margin">Here at Metal Mashup you will find a site that celebrates all things heavy and metal. Yet in an effort to move away from the more mainstream aspects of our scene, Metal Mashup has a much-needed focus on the more underground achievements of our community. Don’t get us wrong though, while we all love a bit of Metallica and still lose our shit every time Hetfield sneezes or Lars manages to keep time, we just feel that there is more to our clan that needs to be celebrated.</p>
