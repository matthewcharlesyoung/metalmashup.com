Stay safe, until the frost is clear<br>
To hide ourselves away, until the sun appears<br><br>

Her voice upon the wind, let’s me know she’s calling<br>
Three have fallen, but we remain, surrounded<br>
Pain turns to absent feeling<br><br>

Our grasp may weaken but our hearts won’t be still<br><br>

Draw near, let us keep our minds,<br>
Don’t let the dark and the cold take your lives<br>

Free your soul before the fire consumes you<br>
Ground yourself, before the winds remove you<br>
Raise your head above, before the earth it buries you<br>
Save your breath, before the waters they drown you<br><br>

How could we let it go this far?<br>

The beacon of hope, shrouded in black<br>
We have to see the dark away, just set the torch alight<br><br>

Set the torch alight<br>

I’m told the end is not far away<br>

Far removed from the image in his mother's eye<br>
This isn't life (this isn't life), this isn't life<br><br>

Burn in the fire, the sulfur is stinging my eyes<br>
Downfall of the liar, you have to pay for all you've sewn<br><br>

Within the cemetery walls<br>
Beyond the colour of stone<br>
I've learned to know<br>
Inside the cemetery walls<br>
You're lost to bones<br>
Within the cemetery walls<br>
Beyond the colour of stone<br>
I've learned to know<br>
Inside the cemetery walls<br>
You're lost to bones<br><br><br>

Is there hope? Is there strength?<br>
You've been looking to the sky for a while<br>
And whilst I've made up my mind<br>
You're seeking solace in the higher<br><br>

I'm fucking buried,<br>
I'm fucking buried in a shallow grave<br>
I guess it's fear that holds me down<br>
I am shrouded in the darkest of days<br>
Will I be saved?<br><br>

Within the cemetery walls<br>
Beyond the colour of stone<br>
I've learned to know<br>
Inside the cemetery walls<br><br>
You're lost to bones<br>
Within the cemetery walls<br>
Beyond the colour of stone<br>
I've learned to know<br>
Inside the cemetery walls<br>
You're lost to bones<br><br>

Was it worth it to sell your soul?<br>
Was it worth it to know you'll always be alone?<br>
Was it worth it to sit upon your fucking throne?<br>
Was it worth it? I guess we'll never know<br>
Was it worth it to sell your soul?<br>
Was it worth it to know you'll always be alone?<br>
Was it worth it to sit upon your fucking throne?<br>
Was it worth it?</p>

          <h1 id="t6" class="lyrics-test">-Restless & Cold-</h1>
          <p class="lyrics-test-test">I am<br>
Broken and cold<br>
Restless and low<br>
I am<br>
A child alone<br>
Lost in the road<br>
I am<br>
Broken and cold<br>
Restless and low<br>
I am<br>
A body without a soul<br><br>

Broken, I feel like my soul has been lifted<br>
For 25 years I've been drifting<br>
A shade so cold, a heart of stone<br>
To the darkness I call my own<br>
I am screaming<br>
'Am I more then just flesh & bone'<br><br>

You don't want me to say, what I've wanted to say<br>
It would unleash a hell<br>
Worst than you've ever known<br>

It wasn't ever meant to end in this way<br>
We kept our heads below<br>
The art of letting go<br>
It wasn't ever meant to feel like this<br>
No<br>
We kept our heads below<br>
The art of letting go<br>

I am knotted, I am twisted<br>
Silence, not a whisper<br>
Mouth sewn shut, you never know who is listening<br>
Haunted<br>
So many things I could never say<br>
For fear of destroying all the progress we've made<br><br>

It wasn't ever meant to end in this way<br>
We kept our heads below<br>
The art of letting go<br>
It wasn't ever meant to feel like this<br><br>
No<br>
We kept our heads below<br>
The art of letting go<br><br>

I am<br>
Broken and cold<br>
Restless and low<br>
I am<br>
A body without a soul

This is where the industry falls<br>
Blow it up, blow it up, blow it up<br>
Tear it down, tear it down, tear it down<br>
It's time to rip apart the walls around your fortress<br>
This isn't bitterness, this is our legacy<br>
You could never be a part of anything real<br>
You lie to sell and teach to steal<br><br>

For all those whose only aim<br>
Is destruction in search of selfish gain<br>
I know that you will never learn<br>
Fuck you for thinking I've been burned<br>
We are the broken<br>
But the fearless ones<br><br>

You are nothing, you are worthless<br>
Don't act like you've earned this<br>
We will expose and let the truth be known<br><br>

301!<br>
Tell me where you came from<br>
We are sick to death of hearing it<br>
301!<br>
Tell me where you came from<br>
We are sick to death of hearing it<br><br>

For all those whose only aim<br>
Is destruction in search of selfish gain<br><br>

I know that you will never learn<br>
Fuck you for thinking I've been burned<br>
We are the broken<br>
But the fearless ones<br><br>

Tell me where you've been and what you've done<br>
And how you're better then everyone<br>
Now you're perfect 'just because'<br>
But to most you're a worthless cunt<br>
No one fucking asked you, no one truly cares<br><br>
Behind my back is your safest bet<br>
Save us all your worthless threats<br>
No on fucking asked you did I say care?<br>
I know you're not the only judge<br>
301<br>
Tell me where you came from<br><br>

I know that you will never learn<br>
Fuck you for thinking I've been burned<br>
We are the broken<br>
But the fearless ones<br><br>

I know that you will never learn<br>
Fuck you for thinking I've been burned<br>
We are the broken<br>
But the fearless ones</p>

          <h1 id="t8" class="lyrics-test">-Memories-</h1>
          <p class="lyrics-test-test">Reveal the plan you have form me<br>
Now I'm lost<br>
Wandering endlessly<br>
I hear<br>
I hear their cries to me<br>
Dragging me backwards eternally<br>
Are you intent on returning me?<br>
To the life I left so violently<br><br>

I am fading<br>
Forever falling<br>
From the shadows<br>
I hear you calling<br>
Always drifting away<br>
To never see the light of day<br><br>

Just a memory gone<br>
Just a memory lost without a cause<br>
Just a memory gone<br>
To be turned to an afterlife alone<br>
Just a memory gone<br>
Just a memory lost without a cause<br>
Just a memory gone<br>
To be turned to an afterlife alone<br><br>

I have seen myself not in reflection<br>
The broken promises that lead to no ascension<br>
I regret my choice but what could I do?<br>
I thought I did my best to be there for you<br>
Cold<br><br>

Just a memory gone<br>
Just a memory lost without a cause<br>
Just a memory gone<br>
To be turned to an afterlife alone<br>
Just a memory gone<br>
Just a memory lost without a cause<br>
Just a memory gone<br>
To be turned to an afterlife alone<br><br>

Just a memory gone<br>
Just a memory lost without a cause<br>
Just a memory gone<br>
To be turned to an afterlife alone<br>
Just a memory gone<br>
Just a memory lost without a cause<br>
Just a memory gone<br>
To be turned to an afterlife alone<br><br>

Just a memory gone (Just a memory gone)<br>
Just a memory lost (Just a memory lost)<br>
Just a memory gone<br>
To be turned to an afterlife alone

          <h1 id="t9" class="lyrics-test">-For Us-</h1>
          <p class="lyrics-test-test">Remember this<br>
Before you speak what's on your lips<br>
You have to change the way you think<br>
If not for me, for you<br><br>

It seems we are born to hate<br>
Eradicate, eradicate, eradicate<br>
Open your eyes to lead the blind<br>
We are the people under one sky<br>
Listen and learn<br>
Hear the ground shake<br>
We're bound to, bound to, bound to break the laws the higher create<br>
Living in a false sense of fate<br><br>

Am I the only one who ever felt like this?<br><br>

Remember this<br>
Before you speak what's on your lips<br>
You have to change the way you think<br>
If not for me, for you<br>
Remember this<br>
Before you speak what's on your lips<br>
You have to change the way you think<br>
If not for me, for you<br><br>

Can't you see we are bound to - break?<br>
Can't you hear the ground shake?<br>
Why must we allow others to dictate?<br>
Can't you see that we are bound to break?<br><br>

Remember this<br>
Before you speak what's on your lips<br>
You have to change the way you think<br>
If not for me, for you<br>
Remember this<br>
Before you speak what's on your lips<br>
You have to change the way you think<br>
If not for me, for you<br><br>

Whether it's the colour of someone's skin,<br>
Or it's the god that they believe in,<br>
It shouldn't matter<br>
It's the same world we are living in<br>
It doesn't have to feel like this<br>
Enough<br><br>

Fighting for borders that don't exist<br>
Condemning others that try to resist<br><br>

Remember this<br>
Before you speak what's on your lips<br>
You have to change the way you think<br>
If not for me, for you<br>
Remember this<br>
Before you speak what's on your lips<br>
You have to change the way you think<br>
If not for me, for you

          <p class="lyrics-test-test">
Welcome to the viper's nest<br>
Don't look into my eyes for comfort<br>
I'll make sure nothing's left<br>
You've never seen anything as evil<br>
I can see the strength within your eyes<br>
Bu I know you've got death upon your lips<br>
Feel the venom from our tongues<br>
It's sick<br>
I, the demon<br><br><br>

I will show you how to lose control<br>
Rip through the mask, reveal a face you've never known<br>
Take from you the time you stole<br>
All I'm owed<br>
You must know<br><br>

Get up<br>
And show me what you think you've learned<br>
I can tell right now you've never been burned<br>
Or ripped apart at the seams<br>
I'll show you disease<br>
The serpent's scales don't weigh in your favor<br>
There's no forgiveness, the is no saviour<br>
Sentenced to the sickness<br><br>

I will show you how to lose control<br>
Rip through the mask, reveal a face you've never known<br>
Take from you the time you stole<br>
All I'm owed<br>
You must know<br><br>

Enemies of disease<br>
Enemies<br>
Enemies of disease<br>
Enemies<br><br>

So you think that you're a king amongst men<br>
Once removed of crown, you'll never rule again<br><br>

This is our bloodline<br>
Risen from the depth<br>
We have bleed enough times, drained, there's nothing left<br>
This is our bloodline<br>
We have bleed enough times
