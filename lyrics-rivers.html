I felt the light draining from the core of me.<br>
The science of constant motion had betrayed every thought of expansion.<br>

Here my remains,<br>
vulnerable and frail limited by<br>
constant conditioning rusted and pale<br>

Unresponsive and worn through,<br>
evolution of absolute solitude<br>
The breaking point of a static,<br>
lifeless dimension has become true<br>

The restless creation mechanism grooves<br>
The returning formation of knowledge that knew.<br>

In well sewn silence,<br>
a symphony vibrates to honor my cells<br>
In realms of guidance,<br>
I'll shepherd them to the oceans swell<br>
<br>
Becoming what I once was again,<br>
Prometheus of a dry river bed.<br>

The agents of a new world structure,<br>
form together in ageless brew.<br>
The essence retained, a semblance of rain,<br>
ceaselessly they call my name.<br>

The glass in two, the rest in nine<br>

Still nothing changes<br>
A simple passage to a place that I have come to know<br>
I still remember<br>

A better time<br>
When the thoughts that we had connected<br>
Between our open eyes<br>
We say goodbye, to a life that’s been mostly silent,<br>

In my self-righteous anger<br>
Oh the years I’ve lost<br>

A solemn duty owned<br>
Mine, it is mine alone<br>
To watch this world expire<br>

Like machines, we embrace<br>
Cold limbs connect<br>
A silent, errored life<br>
Slipping into oblivion<br>

Lead astray through endless days<br>
Silent now, the words so loud<br>

My mind is drifting out<br>
Between perception of a dream and what is real<br>
Now all I have is lost with you<br>
I hope that you remember<br>

A better time<br>
When the lights were all so candescent<br>
That reached me from the sky<br>
We say goodbye, to a life within dead horizons<br>
Erroneously lead.<br>

Strive to escape myself<br>

Sing<br>
You could build it all from nothing<br>

Somewhere the light won't reach us<br>
The sky and the earth that birthed you<br>
Just another burden that hurts too<br>
Much to say, just separate from all<br>

I'd do the same, and leave just how I came<br>

Oh can it be?<br>
I've longed to see that which truly<br>
<br>
Owns the light<br>
A calming wave of incandescent grace<br>
<br>
Spreads its rot<br>
<br>
It's a pale facade<br>
Hands stretching toward the last day beneath the sun<br>
Reaching paradox/in time we will unmake ourselves<br>
It's a pale facade<br>
Secure in your right to remain<br>
Breathing the air you did not earn<br>
<br>
When the sun doesn't rise<br>
And the hope of light fades<br>
Rest these eyes a while<br><br><br>
I'll see your face</p>
