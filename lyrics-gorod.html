      <p class="lyrics-test-test">Redemption always comes from the sky!<br>
<br>
There's no escape. They deserve to perish<br>
Pain and torture will open the gates of mass delirium<br>
Strike all the cowards to the ground, their cursed souls shall never rest<br>
Let my wrath spread upon the infidels so eager to murder their king<br>
<br>
The impure blood that will flow from their wounds<br>
Will never be enough to quench my thirst or avenge this insult<br>
Make them suffer! Make them pay! Souls will plunge into decay<br>
Death by torture! The tormented souls shall be lost in eternal fire<br>
<br>
BURN! The harbingers of death shall be the Birds of Sulphur.<br>
<br>
Faithless! Unholy Forest Dwellers<br>
I will have your bodies charred in the flames of this world<br>
Perun has prepared your stake... eternal<br>
<br>
Heralds of fire<br>
Open the gate to the underworld<br>
Redemption will come from the sky<br>
<br>
The harbingers of death shall be the Birds of Sulphur. BURN<br>
<br>
Attack! Hunt them down ! Hack, chop, dismember<br>
No cell, no prisoner<br>
Burn Iskorosten, burn<br>
Redeeming fire! They will pay with ashes<br>
The Birds of Sulphur shall cleanse our lands of all their sins<br>
Purification through flames. Unleash you fury<br>
Be the heralds of fire and make Iskorosten burn<br>
Spread my wrath<br>
<br>
Redeeming fire will fall from the sky<br>
Fire will fall from the sky</p>

weapon to defeat the enemy<br>
They'll be led to believe they will be borne<br>
in their ship to the castle Lured into the<br>
gaping hole that will close upon them<br>
<br>
They are worthy only of death. We'll bury them all alive<br>
<br>
They shall fall into my pit of vengeance.<br>
Let them sail their grave into the earth<br>
Nothing comes easier than killing a man.<br>
A man who believes he has won the war<br>
The distant leader wants to marry the<br>

Queen to gain ultimate power They came to<br>
declare a truce, trickery,<br>
penance for such abuse<br>
With great honor I send you sailing into the earth<br>
For the murder of the king,<br>

death that he will hear you suffer from the underworld<br>
The heart of a widow is colder than mud<br>
<br>
They are worthy only of death.<br>

We'll bury them all alive They shall fall into my pit of vengeance<br>
Let them sail their grave into the<br>

A man who believes he has won the war<br>
They shall drown in a sea of mud, souls,<br>
damnation, a permanent flood<br>

Great pits will be dug on the shore<br>
to trap and destroy the soldiers<br>
With great honor I send you sailing into<br>

The sovereign of the earth will bring you to your knees<br>
You'll feed the worms and be as one with<br>
the earth I want to feel your suffering and<br>
stamp the earth down over your grave<br>

You shall fall into my pit of vengeance.<br>

      <p class="lyrics-test-test">These statues are no gods<br>
Just useless objects carved of wood Now they may exist<br>
but soon they will be reduced to nothing Left to rot away,<br>
erased by time, their ashes swept away by the wind<br>
<br>
These soulless gods you worship are neither sacred nor human<br>
We only built them with our own hands<br>
But what good have these gods done?<br>
<br>
A single element can sink them into oblivion<br>
What good have done those gods?<br>
We only built them with our own<br>
hands I don't want to give my soul to demons...<br>
<br>
I will lay the foundation stone for<br>
the sacred new empire And God shall be the witness<br>
I'll carry out my flawless plan<br>
Tomorrow everything will change<br>
You'll bow down to me<br>
There is only one God!<br>
Gods who let the kings die don't deserve<br>
to be honored If the regent converts or<br>
give up the kingdom The cult figures shall burn.<br>
They will become meaningless<br>
<br>
Perun alone is worthy to bear the name of God<br>
But as he is a vengeful spirit, he can't wash me of my sins<br>
<br>
I must harness the elements to take my revenge<br>
Let fire burn them, water drown them, earth bury them<br>
And let their cries for mercy be carried on the wind...<br>
only then will I find peace...<br>
Faith will bring us a new way of life, the road to redemption<br>
<br>
When my time comes, I will rejoice in eternal rest Looking<br>
down upon my work from heaven, I will laugh at<br>
the chaos I created I will avenge the King!<br>
Impure blood shall drench the earth<br>
My new road leads south<br>
<br>
I will not look behind me<br>
Moving from hell towards the light, their God is my<br>
God I will lay the foundation stone for the sacred<br>
new empire And God shall be the witness<br>
I'll carry out my flawless plan Tomorrow everything will change<br>
You'll bow down to me</p>

forest and live in harmony with nature<br>
They have knowledge of a territory that is hostile to us<br>
<br>
I know there is nothing they can fear<br>
But the anger of the Queen<br>
The Axe of God The Axe of their own God<br>
<br>
We can't let them have an opportunity to control the entire river<br>
But it would certainly be the best way to bring them down<br>
<br>
Tonight, the Axe will collect a bloody harvest of heads<br>
Let the Almighty Perun lend me strength and bravery<br>
And let the gruesome scene of your impaled bodies along the ways<br>
Reveal to the world the price of such a crime<br>
<br>
Let the Almighty Perun lend me strength and bravery<br>
I swear the eternal oath ! I am now the arm of God<br>
The Axe of God<br>
<br>
You will ever regret your felony<br>
When my soldiers rape your wives<br>
And when I make your children be my slaves until they die<br>
<br>
This is the first tribe that refused to submit to the king's command<br>
They must be the only ones who chose to fight against our will<br>
<br>
Now they no longer believe in knowing the slightest fear<br>
It's time to for them to pay<br>
Befall on their heads the wrath of gods<br>
<br>
I know there is nothing they can fear<br>
But the Axe of their own God<br>
Vengeance is ours<br>
Now, vengeance is mine</p>

I wish you to come by the thousand<br>
Gallons of mead shall be prepared in the city where the King was killed<br>
Let us cry on his grave and have a ceremony for him<br>
<br>
It's in sign of peace I invite you all to a great banquet<br>
I promise that there will be more than enough to eat and drink<br>
You may taste many beverages that even the gods could never dream of<br>
But I cannot give my hand while I am in mourning<br>
<br>
It is time to get to know each other, Now<br>
Let's found a new and stronger kingdom together<br>
Unveil all your secrets<br>
We know how to subjugate<br>
<br>
O dear traitors<br>
Only a blood bath can wash you of your sins<br>
<br>
You will swallow the bitter flood of your own death<br>
<br>
Now you shall face the raging river of our merciless vengeance<br>
You're invited to the funeral that will soon be yours<br>
<br>
Panic Laughter<br>
You'll be howling with pain<br>
When the wine in your mouth turns into blood<br>
Under the sharp daggers of my soldiers<br>
Only your pain will wash your sins<br>
<br>
You will know the punishment of the Luxurious Soon...<br>
Dark blood will feed the earth<br>
Now you shall face the raging river of our merciless vengeance<br>
You're invited to the funeral that will soon be yours</p>

Vengeance fulfilled by the wrath of the Great One<br>
O Perun ! Utter the ancient words of power<br>
Allow me to cast a merciless doom upon them<br>
O Perun ! May we strike them harder than stone<br>
<br>
Let's remember...<br>
We must remind them the holy power belongs only to us<br>
And none but the gods have decided<br>
Varangians always had control of the River<br>
It's time to prove it. It's time to prove it now<br>
<br>
If they feel at one with the earth<br>
I promise they will soon be as one<br>
Their lungs will be filled with mud and worms<br>
They will drown in their own blood<br>
Their bones will be consumed by flames<br>
And their suffering will be engraved in the air<br>
<br>
Let's remember...<br>
We must remind them the holy power belongs only to us<br>
And none but the gods have decided<br>
Varangians always had control of the river<br>
It's time to prove it. It's time to prove it. Now<br>
<br>
We will erect a memorial to the glory of the<br>
King Sculptured by suffering and tormented cries<br>
A divine masterpiece made with our own hands<br>
That will be etched in the winds forever<br>
<br>
I swear he will soon join you. My pain carried by the wind.<br>
I swear I will avenge you. He so wants to take your place...<br>
I'm afraid he has no fear<br>
But I've sworn I will go through with my duty<br>
<br>
The cries of pain shall echo in the air to be carved in the wind<br>
This is how we will accomplish this terrifying work<br>
Let Stribog spread the chant of agony<br>
<br>
Let's remember...<br>
We must remind them the holy power belongs only to us<br>
And none but the gods have decided<br>
Let Stribog spread the chant of their agony<br>
And carve their suffering in the wind

Sin, the Moon God<br>
The talented but deviant lyricist<br>
He's destined to solitary wanderings and adventurous life<br>

I see Nergal, the epitome of zeal and violence<br>
Meant to strike the right balance between action and wildness<br>
Istar is graceful and irresistible<br>
A boundless dedication doomed to fall into madness<br>
<br>
And there is Nebo... the conscientious one<br>
Skillful... and clearly heartless, save for his own ends<br>
A forgotten genius whose cleverness turned into lies<br>
He, the nimble one, who has thrown too many stones<br>
Thus having revenge by enslaving the weak minds<br>
At last a dead star charred by the light of glory<br>
<br>
Thus we shall define our celestial nature<br>
Through the seven stars dwells our vocation... our labor...<br>
<br>
Adar, the order's creator<br>
He's pure and nominated for great works of faith and science<br>
Merodack, the jovial, the one whose name you stole<br>

The consent of the temple<br>

The appalling devotion of our culture<br>
Comes from the boundless timelessness<br>
of those who write, and teach<br>
Our mission is to maintain creation on the peaks,<br>
Out of reach of idle hands<br>
<br>
Mages! We are sailors!<br>
<br>
They applaud all the darings of the mundane,<br>
usurping the genius<br>
That's why our doctrine should operate a redemption<br>

Art is expected to become the cult of times to come<br>
When religion becomes counterfeit, art shall save the vital core<br>
Restoring the holy boundary that separated<br>
idleness from masterwork<br>
Let us redeem creation and recover its priestly conception<br>

Divine rays descend... like on the altar<br>
Art is the real empire<br>
When the human hand draws a perfect line<br>
Angels descend... to mirror themselves<br>
Art is the great miracle<br>
This is the evidence of our timelessness<br>
Art-God, the last reflection from heaven of our downfall<br>

I predict a miracle! Here will triumph<br>

After belief and discipline, creation was yet to be wasted<br>
We lost the standards but I found them again<br>

Those dark times made us forget that art<br>
is invested with a holy mission<br>
It shall create the path to redemption for the salvation of mankind<br>
The Great Revelation<br>
The gallery is the New Church<br>
Weak conferences are preached<br>
Works are the mirrors of light<br>
And the watchers are disciples<br>

I predict a miracle! A rose will rise and open growing<br>
I predict a miracle! Embracing the divine cross of salvation
I predict a miracle! Here will triumph the mystic triad of Artistry

Love, and the suffering it causes reveal<br>
A long windy road to inner perfection<br>
From passion to Holiness...</p>

        <h1 id="s8" class="lyrics-test">-Dig Into Yourself-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">What a pleasing game<br>
to change one's own ancestry<br>
Especially when your last name suffers a lack of majestyv
<br>
You're surely not the son of Bel<br>
But rather the one who holds the spade<br>
<br>
Pretending to teach the government of existence<br>
Soley a self-proclaimed prophet claiming ignorance<br>
<br>
But what is more attractive than becoming a Magus or a Fairy?<br>
How to give meaning to one's own life when one feels good for nothing?<br>
Those of your kind know how to give false praise<br>
In the process of indoctrination<br>
<br>
In the scheme of self-glorification<br>
You couldn't resist this inclination:<br>
Overusing random and puzzling patterns<br>
To please the reckless ones<br>
<br>
But if you really want to honor your lineage<br>
Now grab a spade and dig into yourself<br>
<br>
Who can lead a life on ready-made principles?<br>
Who can be satisfied with a ready-made truth?<br>
A ready-made reality!<br>
Swimming with the tide...<br>
<br>
The time has come for you to honor your lineage<br>
Now grab a spade and dig into yourself<br>
You're surely not the son of Bel<br>
But rather the one who holds the spade

        <h1 id="s9" class="lyrics-test">-Rejoice Your Soul-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Let me rejoice your soul<br>
<br>
Holy Baptism made us the children of God<br>
Society dedicated us to evil<br>
In constant conflict with our culture<br>
Only faith can keep us away from the vultures<br>
<br>
There is no wisdom without deprival<br>
No salvation for the rebels<br>
Let me entice you into another world<br>
We will teach you the government of yourself
And show you the way to light<br>
So let me enlighten your mind<br>
Let me rejoice your soul<br>
<br>
Seek only the magical power of your inner excellence<br>
Improve yourself and become radiant<br>
And as the Sun, heat latent ideal life around you<br>
Come to me/ Be my disciple/ See the light<br>
Forsake the seven bad habits<br>
<br>
Cut yourself off from your peers<br>
Otherwise you will suffer without growing<br>
Deny the commonwealth, forget all others, to rise to personality<br>
<br>
"Then you shall see the radiant;<br>
Your heart shall thrill and exult,<br>
Because the abundance of the sea shall be turned to you,<br>
The wealth of nations shall come to you" Isaiah 60:5<br>
<br>
We own the rational knowledge that will engage the Renewal of Society<br>
I own the spiritual essence that will lead to the Renewal of Man<br>
I am the heir of Bel, the demiurge<br>
The Lord of the world<br>
The master of all the lands<br>
I do belong to the holy Order that committed my fate,<br>
That will commit your fate<br>
<br>
And you'll know an extraordinary destiny...</p>

        <h1 id="s10" class="lyrics-test">-Syncretic Delirium-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Coalesce to this spiritual family<br>
Which arrogated a mythical and whimsical descent<br>
Unable to write a line without spitting in one's face<br>
Your self-named origins from Assyria<br>
<br>
A dreamlike being that feeds on the world of legend<br>
<br>
Remind yourselves that you are only men<br>
And none of you have yet accessed the heavenly or astral state<br>
<br>
You seem to suffer from a disease of lyricism<br>
Your doctrine appears to be a Syncretic Delirium<br>
<br>
Fashioned with any kind of magic and occult science<br>
Mingling your own Church with ideals from the East<br>
<br>
I forbid you excuses and push you away<br>
I force you into silence and disgrace<br>
<br>
You seem to suffer from a disease of lyricism<br>
Your doctrine appears to be a Syncretic Delirium<br>
<br>
A dreamlike being that feeds on the world of legend<br>
<br>
Indulging yourself in all kinds of digressions<br>
Abandoned to the whims of your own diction<br>
<br>
You seem to suffer from a disease of lyricism<br>
Your doctrine appears to be a Syncretic Delirium<br>
<br>
The discordant pages of your works held together only by the binding<br>
Creator of a real disorder which finally laid you on the line<br>
<br>
I forbid you excuses and push you away<br>
I force you into silence and disgrace</p>
