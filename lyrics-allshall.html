      <p class="lyrics-test-test">I witnessed your death<br>
You gave it up to the rape of indifference<br>
Now take those dreams to die.<br><br>

So can you feel it now?<br>
It's just that question of letting the end<br>
Be the answer.<br>
Now...its pulling us down<br>
These days become years watching<br>
Time disappear<br><br>

Again again again<br>
I won't give in.<br>

This is a misfits rejection<br>
Of a life in submission<br><br>

Your choice<br>
Destroys<br>
What life could be<br>

You just sold out quick<br>
Talk is some cheap shit<br>
Can you remember the last time that your life<br>
Meant more than fucking payments?<br>
Know this...I quit!<br><br>

Wealth means shit<br>
Tell me what's right...<br>
You got the cash<br>
But you're hollow within<br>
So much worse than that mortal sin<br><br>

This is it..<br>
This is my life<br>
You can't buy me<br>

Tell me I'm worthless 'cause net worth<br>
Determines a man<br>
I won't give in<br><br>

When slave wage brings chains made<br>
To keep you conformed 'cause they can<br>
I won't give in<br>

I'll keep on struggling<br>
'Cause that's the measure of a man<br><br>

Right?<br>

Your dreams are disavowed<br>
So you must feel it now!<br>
It's just that question of letting the end be the answer.<br>
Now...it's pulling us down<br><br>

These days becomes years<br>
Watching time disappear<br>

Again again and again<br>

I will never let them break me down<br>
These hands will never be bound<br><br>

In greed you can drown, in greed you can drown<br>

But I will still be dreaming<br>
Yeah
And I will still be fighting<br>

What more can anyone say? you have lost your way.</p>

Will they hear the voice of resistance or will they bring us down for their bloodshed?<br>
Trade us all 'til black gold rains<br>
Fought this fight, there's no end in sight except for our rights<br>
Will they blind us all?<br>
"Be all that you can be"<br>
Forever in vain, our wasted beliefs<br><br>
Erase the truth<br>
So with that fall from grace will they burn it all down in emphatic<br>
Fading away<br>
Fading away<br>

To when we began<br>
Forever from cleansing the blood from our hands<br><br>
Release the truth<br>
Destroyed in anguish, another million faceless<br>
And I wish we had eyes to view our demise<br>
Tomorrow, together we rise<br>
With their fallen disguise we must hunt the despised<br><br>
Thieves; high class murderers<br>
They can't taste this anger that flows through our veins<br>
A separation of our own god damned nation that lets us die<br>
Leaders that follow a golden tomorrow<br>

And those deafening voices blames me<br>
But that's more than I'm trying to hear<br><br>
So let the pain revive you<br>
Never let me get inside you<br>
Never...again.<br>
Let's just oppress this demon within<br><br>
The abyss is a friend<br>
You breathe deceit<br>
And I'm surprised I still stand on my feet<br>
You know that I live<br>
I breathe hate<br>
Our days were agony<br><br>
And therefore so tragically<br>
There was satisfaction<br>
Hate fucking in apathy<br>
So fucking tell me<br>
Were there days when things were so much better?<br><br>
Before you were such a self loathing hateful bitch.<br>
Recognize the hell that you're spewing forth<br>
What we might have shared is nothing anymore<br>
What you said to me<br>
Was never meant to be<br>
Never.... again....

A call of arms begins the motion.<br>
There is no good bye no second glances for in the midst<br>
We, we see a glimpse<br>
Of mass oppression coming to take our lives<br><br>
They can't take our fight<br>
We're living free of monarchy<br>
Brothers take hands<br><br>
It's our time to give this nation its only chance.<br>
Not one step back<br>

Liberty rings echoing through the streets the beginning of everything.<br>
Take pride for this is the picture we must live by or die, or die<br><br>

And now betrayed is where they lay.<br>
Letting hatred build the falling of your system
It's their turn to send you flailing and burning into hellish dissention.<br>
Loathesome talent<br>
Fleeting<br><br>
Rehashed bullshit makes you all not worth a piss<br>
Bound in your false pretense<br>
We laugh at this as it slowly becomes your end<br>
It's how...<br><br>
It's how you live the end<br>

Can't believe how you have lost touch with this<br>
They mourn the loss of valiant fools all glam and glitz<br>
Come back, last chance to take a useful stance<br>
Instead of just saying to say things that you biggots wish for but won't ever have<br><br>
No chance<br><br>

They are the<br>
Ones who bring life to us<br>
Fucking Family<br>
How could you betray them<br>
What money tied with your platinum chains<br>
Fuck, you're cheap<br>
Bought for a few pennies<br>
Now you're all just empty fucking souless machines<br><br>

Rip you apart<br>
As they scurry around at your feet<br>
Leave you to wither as if you ever meant anything your death<br>
Gives breath<br>
For new breeds<br>

Back into the new hope for all<br>
Left<br><br>

Did we stay young 'til we died?<br>
Are just clarified and classified?<br><br>
I still see the summer sky...<br><br>
Has stripped, raped and strangled ever made you cry?<br>
Our...black metal hearts drown in black water parks<br>
Damnation...delivered us back to the start<br>

Cursed forever...undead...I am<br><br>
Once upon that crucifixion<br>
We reigned in blood like death had risen, we destroyed the opposition<br>
Our...black metal hearts drown in black water parks<br>
Damnation...delivered us back to the start<br>
Are my arms your hearse if these metaphors stop?<br>
Without these songs, I would just be so lost<br><br>
So lost<br>
When she rides, I'm stuck in that horror hotel, cursing all 20 eyes<br>
When she rides...when she rides<br>
Well it's 2 minutes past the midnight hour and you hate my voice like sugar coated sour<br>
Caress that carcass<br><br>
I miss your heartworks<br>
My swansong, so insalubrious<br>
Pouring sweat but the fever remains<br>

We are the masses, We cannot be weak<br>
Free will is just an image don't buy into their greed<br>
Government has run wild, the proof is plain to see<br><br>
They preach sophistication while they rape, lie, and cheat</p>

        <h1 id="s9" class="lyrics-test">-My Retaliation-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">I hope to see you fucking die<br><br>

To watch as you scour around for someone to save you<br>
You'll beg for mercy<br>
On deaf ears your cries will fall<br>
You worthless coward<br>
I am the one sending you to hell<br><br>

Sat through your bullshit stories, of all that we would become<br>
I thought you had the best intentions but you looked out for number one<br><br>

Time has shown that all your distractions were merely a hoax Your tricks are amateur at best<br>
Your pockets get thicker with each puff of smoke.<br>
Take your ass back to school<br><br>
Manipulation of all those who followed shows us that you have no control<br>
Shows us that you have no control<br>

It does not take a genius to understand all that you're about.<br>
The erratic displacement of all of your benefit. What a<br>
miserable fucking joke.<br><br>

We all danced for your enjoyment, now the music is over and the shoes are on you<br>
Let me show you step one, take your fucking head right out of your ass<br>
Learn your place within the pack and you can share in the feast as well<br>
You continue to work against yourself<br>
There's no pity left for you<br><br>

The truth is the world is full of people like you<br>
It's not just here within our walls that someone<br>
Can sway so heavily the way things work<br><br>

You're going down<br>
My fists are clenched tight<br>
Ready to strike against you<br>
I embody the vengeance<br>
Of all who stand against you<br><br>

My fists are clenched right<br>
Ready to strike against you<br>
I embody the vengeance<br>
Of all who stand against you<br><br>

I hope to see you fucking die<br>
I hope to see you fucking die<br>
I hope to see you fucking die

        <h1 id="s10" class="lyrics-test">-Rebirth-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Rebirth of a lost way of life<br>
A mentality quickly abandoned<br>
This dominion will rise up from ruin<br>
But not without a grotesque demise<br><br>

Do not forget what life is meant to symbolize<br>
The true test of one's personal stature<br>
The strength of will has arrived to direct us<br>
This pitiful erroneous understanding has left us<br><br>
Left us depraved<br>

Who has sent this place into perdition?<br>

What scapegoat can we create?<br><br>
Only to ourselves can we truly lie<br>
No one cares about your decisions<br>
The affected move on without you<br>
Face the emptiness you create<br><br>

You create<br>
You create<br><br>

We are the only ones to blame for this disaster<br>
The few make an effort while the rest rot away<br>
Crown yourselves the kinds and queens of lethargy<br>
Within you lies the momentum of change<br><br>

Dissolving this distasteful life we lead<br>
While we all drift away<br>
We came searching for someone to blame<br>
We hurt the ones we care the most<br><br>

This place of solitude will bring out the deepest secrets we all push down<br>
Mass reckoning will leave us all out in the cold<br>
Hoard of derelict vermin<br><br>

We will be begging for absolution<br>
Dissolving this fucked up life we lead<br><br>

Let the sounds of disaster take you away<br>
Let the waves of redemption crash down on you</p>

        <h1 id="s11" class="lyrics-test">-The Death Plague-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Cold chill running up into the cortex<br>
My eyes turn black with the hinder for flesh<br>
I wander around broken and aimless smelling of death<br>
A lifeless cadaver needing nourishment<br>

We sooth to no end a hunger that will not subside<br>
The animalistic impulse that keeps us alive<br><br>

The sounds of prey fighting for life bring me to find the soon to be pile of rotting stench<br>
Satisfaction has temporarily come over me and once its gone I move on towards another feed<br><br>

We are the foul infestation<br>
We are resilient<br>
Soon as I bite my children live on, living as death incarnate<br>
We where conceived as a plague<br>
A cataclysmic device<br><br>

You will tremble in agoraphobic fear for the outside will become a place unwelcome to your kind<br>

We are the dominant species<br><br>

You do not have a choice<br>
I'll come from the shadows to tear you apart<br>

We are the dominant spices<br>

You do not have a choice<br>
You will become a feast, toss the scraps to the dogs<br>

We are the dominant species<br>

Species<br><br>

We are the foul infestation<br>
We are the resilient<br>
Soon as I bite my children live on, living as death incarnate<br>
Cataclysmic device<br>

With every passing moment my kind grows strong<br>
We only serve our primal instinct<br>
We've set our eyes upon you<br><br>

We are the dominant species<br>
We are the dominant species

        <h1 id="s12" class="lyrics-test">-In This Life Of Pain-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">You fucking disgust me<br>

My hatred for you grows with every breath you take<br>
You only exist to lie, those eyes are treacherous<br>
It's like a ball inside, the rage I hide<br>
With a smile on my face<br><br>

This demon will not subside<br>
I live to make you suffer, to show you how rotten true love can be<br>
In our fate lies an institution<br>
A prison of the mind this life sentence is your disease<br><br>

I've seen you distrust and manipulate those who love you<br><br>

I am your only choice in this life of pain<br>
I am your only choice in this life of pain<br><br>

I knew it all along<br>
You'd cross me<br>
This should have been cut off and left to fade away<br>
For you I gave<br>
But still I crave<br>
To see your broken heart you fucking wretched waste<br><br>

This demon will not subside<br>
I'll trap you in this room<br>
Where no one will ever hear your screams<br>
In this place lies my restitution<br>
A burdened heart no more<br>
You've lost all power over me<br><br>

I am your only choice in this life of pain<br>
(You fucking disgust me)<br>
I am your only choice in this life of pain<br><br>

We have only suffered<br>
So why do we have to see ourselves in perfect pictures<br>
Perfection will never exist as long as we breathe

        <h1 id="s13" class="lyrics-test">-Nobleza En Exilio-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">En nuestro alcance lo tuvimos<br>
Lo tomamos en vano y así se nos fue mintieron lloramos sin acer nada<br>
Muy pronto las cadenas nunca se van a romper<br><br>

Olvida la vida perfecta las cosas cambiaran<br>

Somos el odio<br>
La muerte te esperara<br><br>

Un cambio mundial rompio la fortaleza humana<br>
No se queden quietos mientras la vida se les va<br>
Mandaron el govierno para sangrarnos de nuestra vida<br>

Y al regreso nos entregan la muerte<br><br>

Pueblos unidos hamas nos quebraran<br>
Libertad es una imagen no te lo creas<br>
El govierno es salvaje las pruebas están en ti<br>
Predican sus ideales puras mentiras te entregan a ti puras metiras te<br><br>
Entregan a ti<br>

Los inocentes sangraran<br>
Nueastra propia ignorancia nos a hecho a si<br>
Ya he visto donde nos lleva<br>
Una vida torturada mientras nos echamos a reir<br>
Somos la burla de sus chistes alli veras se reiran<br><br>

En nuestro alcance lo tuvimos<br>
Lo tomamos en vano y así se nos fue mintieron lloramos sin acer nada<br>
Muy pronto las cadenas nunca se van a romper<br><br>

Pueblos unidos hamas nos quebraran<br>
Libertad es una imagen no te lo creas<br><br>
El govierno es salvaje las pruebas estan en ti<br>
Predican sus ideales puras metiras te entregan a ti puras metiras te entregan a ti</p>
