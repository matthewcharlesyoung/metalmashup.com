If the world could see who you are<br>
Would you run, would you run?<br>
You've lost your heart, you've gone too far<br>
Look what you've become, you've become<br>
I could turn this all around<br>
'Cause I don't want to be like you (be like you)<br>
But I know this is something I have to do<br>
<br>
I will take you and all the things that you've done<br>
Make you wish you never saw another "setting sun"<br>
With your neck under my knee<br>
And my arm raised high<br>
Someone's gonna die<br>
<br>
Forgive? Forget?<br>
I laugh at the thought of that<br>
Yeah, you better run<br>
You will regret the day you betrayed me and your "family"<br>
<br>
Six feet underneath, a bloody history<br>
Six feet underneath, you never cared for forgiveness</p>

        <p class="lyrics-test-test">With these thoughts on my mind,<br>
I'll never sleep<br>
With this pain so deep, I'll be dead before they find me<br>
Devil, devil, devil<br>
I'll be dead before they find me<br>
<br>
You held the thoughts in the back of your spine<br>
Feeding me hope for something I would never find<br>
You know they say "the strong survive"? (The strong survive)<br>
I won't stop at anything, for you to have a painful ending<br>
I'm "pathetic" (pathetic)<br>
You're the "heartless" (the heartless)<br>
I'm a "trainwreck" (a trainwreck)<br>
You're the "heartless"<br>
<br>
When you look into the eyes<br>
Does the rain fall through the deep blue skies?<br>
Are you too blind to see, you're just a devil?<br>
<br>
With these thoughts on my mind, I'll never sleep<br>
With this pain so deep, I'll be dead before they find me<br>
Devil, devil, devil<br>
I'll be dead before they find me<br>
<br>
I'll never sleep, with this pain so deep<br>
There is no place to shake this agony<br>
No way to break these chains<br>
It's in my heart you see<br>
There is no way to save my life<br>
When I'm sleeping next to the devil at night<br>
<br>
I'm "pathetic" (pathetic)<br>
You're the "heartless" (the heartless)<br>
I'm a "trainwreck" (a trainwreck)<br>
You're the "heartless"<br>
<br>
When you look into your eyes<br>
Does the rain fall through the deep blue skies?<br>
Are you too blind to see, you're just a devil?<br>
<br>
With these thoughts on my mind, I'll never sleep<br>
With this pain so deep, I'll be dead before they find me<br>
Devil, I'm sleeping next to the devil at night<br>
Devil, I'm sleeping next to the devil at night<br>
Devil, I'm sleeping next to the devil at night<br>
Devil, I'm sleeping next to the devil at night</p>

Open your eyes<br>
You claim to be the one with the perfect life<br>
Playing the role of a perfect child<br>
You're just a pig<br>
A pig dressed like a sheep<br>
<br>
How do you sleep?<br>
If I'm on my way, I'm taking you to hell<br>
<br>
Pray for mercy<br>
Pray, pray for me<br>
<br>
You really think you're a king<br>
You're just a pig dressed like a sheep<br>
You really think you'll get away with this?<br>
The role you're playing doesn't end with forgiveness<br>
<br>
First step: dealing with the guilt<br>
You can't be the intellectual cowards that just needed your ten percent<br>
I said it: never trust anyone who's not a skeptic<br>
Your face can't hide it, I'm so misguided<br>
<br>
Yeah, you claim to be the one with the perfect life<br>
Playing the pig with the constant smile<br>
You're just a pig<br>
Haha, a pig dressed like a sheep<br>
A pig just like a sheep<br>
I'm taking you to hell<br>
<br>
Pray for mercy<br>
Pray, pray for me<br>
<br>
You really think you're a king?<br>
You're just a pig dressed like a sheep<br>
You really think you'll get away with this?<br>
The role you're playing doesn't end with forgiveness<br>
<br>
I just wanted to be good enough<br>
Don't you ever tell me what I am<br>
I've tried to be the best I can be<br>
I am free to fall short<br>
I've got an illness and no matter what I do<br>
I'm a ghost to you<br>
From this point on, you're a ghost to me<br>
You'll always be a ghost to me</p>

        <p class="lyrics-test-test">My mind's wandering lately<br>
Tossing, turning in a daze instead of sleeping<br>
These endless nights are getting scary<br>
<br>
Losing sense of reality<br>
When I tell you what you want to hear<br>
Do you ever fear me?<br>
When I lie next to you in fear<br>
Do you ever hear me?<br>
<br>
These nights are getting worse (getting worse)<br>
Sleepwalking into my own hearse<br>
<br>
My God, have I lost my voice?<br>
I'm screaming but no one can hear me<br>
Have I lost my mind?<br>
I'm dying and no one can save me<br>
<br>
I try running but my legs are still<br>
I try gasping for air, my longs are desperate to fill<br>
There is a demon creeping down my spine<br>
Is it really in my mind or am I gonna die?<br>
<br>
These nights are getting worse (getting worse)<br>
Sleepwalking into my own hearse<br>
<br>
My God, have I lost my voice?<br>
I'm screaming but no one can hear me<br>
Have I lost my mind?<br>
I'm dying and no one can save me<br>
My thoughts, they burn so deep<br>
I think too much and it eats away at me<br>
I'm just a tragedy but that's OK with me<br>
I'll give the world what they're asking for<br>
<br>
Sleep paralysis<br>
I can't escape this<br>
My only fear is not knowing who I am anymore<br>
My only fear is inside me<br>
<br>
Have I lost my voice?<br>
I'm screaming but no one can hear me<br>
Have I lost my mind?<br>
I'm dying and no one can save me<br>
My thoughts, they burn so deep<br>
I think too much and it eats away at me<br>
I'm just a tragedy but that's OK with me<br>

And if I'll ever come back home<br>
Give it up!<br>
<br>
They say, "He wandered down a broken road<br>
Lost the heart that he once knew<br>
Thought she was the angel to his hope"<br>
She was the devil that stole my soul<br>
I've given up<br>
<br>
Please forgive me, for I am not who I used to be (used to be)<br>
Please forgive me, death was my heart's destiny<br>
Destiny!<br>
<br>
(If all you see, if all you see)<br>
If all you see is the bad in me then please walk away, walk away<br>
If all you see is the broken man in me then please stay and help me<br>
<br>
She looked like angel, was a devil at heart<br>
Left me broken, beaten, had me fooled from the start<br>
<br>
Please forgive me, for I am not who I used to be (used to be)<br>
Please forgive me, death was my heart's destiny<br>
Destiny!<br>
<br>
I keep telling myself that I'll find a home<br>
This whole world isn't cold, I won't die alone<br>
I try and try, but these demons on the inside<br>
They know the dirty truth and so do I<br>
<br>
If all you see is the bad in me then please walk away, walk away<br>
If all you see is the broken man in me then please stay and help me<br>
I'm broken, beaten, left to die on the inside<br>
Please forgive me!</p>

Day and night, that won't stop us<br>

They killed our brothers, took our wives to die slow<br>
They fill our minds with the sickest lies<br>

And you better not get it wrong<br>
I've got a story to tell about a man damned for hell<br>
One face, two lives<br>
Struggling to fight the beast inside<br>
I used to win but lately all I've been is Mr. Hyde<br>
<br>
You wanted a story?<br>
Hahaha, well you got one...<br>
<br>
No doctor, no medicine<br>
Not the devil I hate, I hear he loves me<br>
No pastor, no saving<br>
Not the God I love, they say He hates me<br>
Get inside my head, nothing but arguments<br>
<br>
They say that "I'm a good guy, with a promising life"<br>
I'm such a dark soul, destroying everything I love<br>
I've got some issues, I've got a short fuse<br>
I've learned to love being used, I am my own downfall<br>
My own downfall<br>
<br>
No doctor, no medicine<br>
Not the devil I hate, I hear he loves me<br>
No pastor, no saving<br>
Not the God I love, they say He hates me<br>
Nothing will put this curse to an end<br>
I've tried to kill, I've tried to kill<br>
I've tried to kill these voices inside my head<br>
Put this curse to an end, put this curse to an end<br>
<br>
You wanted a disaster<br>
You think I'm on the verge, I'm very clever<br>
<br>
I am so sorry but this world can't save me<br>
I am my own downfall<br>
My own downfall!

Yet in an effort to move away from the more mainstream aspects of our scene, Metal Mashup has a much-needed focus on the more underground achievements of our community. Don’t get us wrong though, while we all love a bit of Metallica and still lose our shit every time Hetfield sneezes or Lars manages to keep time, we just feel that there is more to our clan that needs to be celebrated.</p>
