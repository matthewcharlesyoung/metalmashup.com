But what scares me the most is I'm starting to feel at home<br>
I know, I know I can't stay here forever,<br>
when we lose ourselves we find each other<br><br>

I find this strange comfort in being lost in life<br>
Wherever I end up will I belong there this time?<br>
So when you feel your heart sink into your chest<br>
Don't forget everything is okay in the end<br>
We are not okay but this is not the end yet<br><br>

We are not okay but this is not the end yet<br>
We are not okay but this is not the end<br><br>

I know, I know I'm lost, I know, I know I'm lost<br>
But what scares me the most is I'm starting to feel at home<br>
I know, I know I can't stay here forever,<br>
when we lose ourselves we find each other</p>

hope with catchy hooks and melodies and make you sing along<br>
Well I titled this whole album before I tried to write a song<br>
And the truth is hope can be a burning sun<br>
The closer that you seem to get the quicker you get lost in the sight of<br>
It keeps casting it's shadow of our burdens behind,<br>
us and the more we try stand inside the light<br>
The more a darkness seems to grow<br>
Is darkness the shade where I've found peace<br>
<br>
So maybe this time I need to be standing for someone to believe<br>
Like a weathered oak with know hope carved in me<br>
So maybe this time I need to be standing for someone to believe<br>
You can take the life from me but I'll always be here standing,<br>
Still very time you need me<br>
Hope is at the root but each day<br>
It's still casting a shadow of my darkness behind me<br>
And the more I try to show you with the light<br>
The more a darkness seems to follow<br>
You will never change what you refuse to face<br>
Like a shadow we always grow every time we try to find the light<br>
<br>
So maybe this time I need to be standing for someone to believe<br>
Like a weathered oak with know hope carved in me<br>
So maybe this time I need to be standing for someone to believe<br>
You can take the life from me<br>
Maybe this time I need to be<br>
Maybe this time I need to be me<br>
You don't know who you are anymore<br>
Tonight I don't know either but we are standing still<br><br>

We can't be moved<br>
When hope is at the root of you<br>
Every time the wind grows still and I continue to lose movement<br>
You are there to walk up chin down and carve your name<br>
Every time the wind grows still and life pushes you further<br>
Come carve your name<br>
Know hope in me</p>

And some days you are the statue<br>
Some days you're meant to just sit back and observe<br>
While the world takes its turn and just shits all over you<br>
Some days you need the rain because no one gets paid<br>
To come clean up the messes that life makes all over you<br>
I don't know who I am in this moment<br>
I know I disappoint you<br>
You don't know who I am anymore<br>
Well that makes two of us<br>
Are you following a god and this song got in the way<br>
I'm sorry I'm sorry but I am not sorry<br>
Is this the truth, the light, the sight,<br>
the roots, or the noose<br><br>
Everyone is religious only until they don't need to be anymore<br>
That's not faith no not to me<br>
All I have let to make are memories and mistakes<br>
And new questions I'll take to the grave<br>
Do you know how it feels to have your past sink<br><br>
it's teeth right into your back<br>
Only to turn around and see yourself<br>
Keep the hell away from me<br>
The devil you know is better than the devil you don't<br>

For once I don't want to float face down<br><br>

We've been deserted, that doesn't mean that we deserve it<br>
Is it worth it, keeping ourselves at bay<br><br>

You can try and fail, but don't fail to try<br>
Do I deserve this<br>
If you're deserted, you can't desert it<br>
You can never leave an island in your<br>
Mind until you lose sight of the shoreline<br>
You can try and fail, but don't fail to try<br>
Some people spend their entire lives in exile<br>
You can't never leave, an island<br>
Until you lose sight of the shoreline<br>
Times like these they come in waves<br>
Make your footprint and send it right back away<br><br>

All you're saying to me tonight, here in the open skyline<br>
Without darkness, no star can learn to guide the way<br><br>

Sometimes it takes your whole world falling apart<br>
To really know what you stand for<br>
What do you stand for<br>
Life falls apart but did you ever see where every piece could land<br>
Maybe pieces of you were preplanned to fall apart<br>
So they could fall together<br>
So they fall in place for someone else<br><br>

And you said that you needed a voice<br>
And I needed a reason<br>

Mother, I just needed you to know.<br>
Something good grew out from all of the cracks inside our broken home.<br>
I am a lonely soul, a kid flying his kite alone.<br>
Or am I just a head in the clouds, welcoming wind every time there's a storm?<br><br>

Where do I go now?<br>
I grew up in a house God built with the devils blueprints with no foundation found.<br>
I went to hell to have some words with the devil about what he did, but it was empty.<br><br>
Everyone moved out.<br><br>

Mother, I just needed you to know<br>

And father, I needed you the most<br>
But I'm still a kid in aging skin, a hypocrite trying to grow.<br>

Every time I try<br>
To bury the wreckage of that old house in my mind.<br>
I see the same crow on the power line.<br>
He could have flown to any other home,<br>
But he'll never stop chasing mine.<br>
He’ll never stop chasing mine.<br><br>

You call it a demon<br>
I call it self sabotage in hiding<br>
You call it a demon<br>
Or is happiness a mediocre sin?

          <p class="lyrics-test-test">And now I know there's a place in my mind I go.<br>
Secluded, where my head is quick but my heart is slow.<br>
I bottle things up for too long waiting on someone to find me.<br>
I'm a message lost in a sinking sea.<br><br>

We all want to be found and held so close<br>
so all that we know that is broken falls back together.<br><br>

No one is ever going to believe in yourself for you<br>
and every false belief that you think is true was put inside of you.<br>
Imperfection and not accepting who you are, I'm guilty too.<br>
Your imperfections make you perfect to me.<br>
Now learn to just stay you.<br><br>

Everyone you know is fighting a battle of their own.<br>
Now do unto yourself what your neighbors never show.<br>
What a world we live in we’re falling for everything and anyone but us.<br><br>

You just want somebody to love the hell out of you<br>
but you will never find that kind of love in someone before yourself.<br><br>

We all want to be found and held so close<br>
so all that we know that is broken falls back together.<br><br>

No one is ever going to believe in yourself for you<br>
and every false belief that you think is true was put inside of you.<br>
Imperfection and not accepting who you are, I'm guilty too.<br>
Your imperfections make you perfect to me.<br>
Now learn to just stay you.<br><br>

I understand you more than you think I do.<br>
Stop looking up to me start looking up to you.<br>
Imperfection and not accepting who you are, I’m guilty too.<br>
Will you spend another day believing what the world wants you to?<br><br>

No one is ever going to believe in yourself for you<br>
and every false belief that you think is true was put inside of you.<br>
Imperfection and not accepting who you are, I'm guilty too.<br>
Your imperfections make you perfect to me.<br>
Now learn to just stay you.<br>
Learn to just stay you.</p>

to see if anyone is noticing.<br>
No one has been there to listen<br>
all the more reason to sing.<br>
I promise this won’t last forever.<br>
I don't want to let you make that choice.<br>
You don't need to abuse your arms but use your voice.<br><br>

I know right now you think that no one is listening.<br>
If we fall together, we'll live forever and never grow alone.<br><br>

When I look out, I see a field of youth<br>
and it is filled with doubt.<br>
A field of flowers pulling their petals off way too soon.<br>
One by one. Dropping like flies no one is speaking up.<br><br>

I know right now you think that no one is listening.<br>
If we fall together, we'll live forever and never grow alone.<br>
You can grow out from decay<br>
but what you do with your today<br>
can resonate to everything, keep growing.<br><br>

We've been pulled from the earth.<br>
We know but we can still grow though.<br>
We've both started to die and slow.<br>
Why pick ourselves early?<br>
We're dying here anyways.<br>
Remember I can show you light,<br>
but you will have to learn<br>
how to grow on your own.<br>
What is a rose with no thorn?<br><br>

I know right now you think that no one is listening.<br>
If we fall together, we'll live forever and never grow alone.<br>
<br>
You can grow out from decay<br>

          <p class="lyrics-test-test">And sometimes the most beautiful pain in life<br>
is the kind you can't disguise or hide.<br>
And the hard truth about life.<br>
If I'm not allowed to give up on mine,<br>
you are not allowed to not even try.<br><br>

One day at a time you'll have to remake<br>
the same decision as the one I made last night.<br>
<br>
You and I have already started to die.<br>
And now that I understand, why I've never felt quite so alive.<br>
And I feel like I've sang about scars a hundred times<br>
but for the record I’ve found the reason for mine.<br><br>

And sometimes we need to find a reason<br>
for the pain in our own lives.<br>
Mine was you and I promise this song<br>
is a place for the truth.<br>
We can’t keep hiding and hurting.<br>
I know I’ve tried to.<br><br>

One day at a time we just might have to remake<br>
the decision every day for the rest of life.<br>
<br>
You and I have already started to die.<br>
And now that I understand, why I've never felt quite so alive.<br>
And I feel like I've sang about scars a hundred times<br>
but for the record I’ve found the reason for mine.<br>
<br>
And for the record, I'm in California still writing one day at a time.<br>
And for the record, I refuse to be ashamed of all my scars.<br>
You and I are both the same.<br>
<br>
We've already cheated death so many times.<br>
If we’re going to die, why not cheat it again tonight?<br>
<br>
You and I have already started to die.<br>
And now that I understand, why I've never felt quite so alive.<br>
And I feel like I've sang about scars a hundred times<br>

I'm trying to feel it's not very rich nothing stays golden<br>
Yesterday is in the past but tomorrow I don't see coming<br>
We have a gift a new today but I'm so sick of the present<br>
I'm breathing just fine but am I alive<br>
I'm living safe as a lonesome soul<br><br>
But I'm dying to feel so much less alone<br>
I'm reaching out but I'm feeling nothing<br>
As heavy-hearted as a feather with no wind<br>
And broken-hearted moving in circles<br>
Like an angel with one wing<br>
I'm still there walls surrounding me<br>
I'm still there with bricks others have thrown<br><br>
I'm reaching out but I'm feeling nothing</p>

Floating on like a plastic bag without a home<br>
Pages folded became paper planes that we could fly<br>
We've clipped every wing we used to fly<br><br>

Your wings might be broken but it's not too late<br>
You hide your emotions so you can escapev
You cant be afraid to make mistakes<br>
And you can't fake perfection<br><br>

Broken compass still moving forward<br>
A constant north the one I'll never know<br>
Like everything I gravitate to what ends up killing me<br>
We're separated by a hell of a lot more than the sky<br>

I'm sick of always giving when there's nothing left to lose<br>
That place we're in is breaking<br>
It's try to break me too<br><br>

I built these walls to keep the outside world from me<br>
And I'll fight to stay in the hell of my own mind<br>
It's safer on the inside<br>
Underneath where you can't ever get to me<br>
And I'll fight to stay in the hell of my own mind<br>
It's safer on the inside (built these walls)<br><br>

Chaos reigns<br>
Inside of all of us<br>
All this pain<br>
It's not where I belong<br>
It's not my fate<br>
You're a hypocrite<br>
You're the dying proof of it<br>

With empty hands I came into<br>
this world, and I'll leave just the same<br><br>

Death, you cannot take me,<br>

With everything so deafening,<br>
each breath worth fighting for<br>
I refuse to be your casualty<br>
cause pain has its reward<br>
No longer trapped in agony,<br>
you cannot take me, I survive the storm<br><br>

Is hell a place or just a word,<br>
because as far as I can see<br>
They both feel like one in the same,<br>
so which do I believe?<br>
Some days we feel everything<br>
and others not at all<br>
Do I cave beneath the weight<br>
or rise above it all?<br><br>

Death, you cannot take me,<br>

Maybe that's the hell that I'm living<br>
Battles between where I'm numb or I'm feeling<br>
Remember when we filled our lives<br>
With the will to fucking live<br><br>

Death, you cannot take me,<br>
