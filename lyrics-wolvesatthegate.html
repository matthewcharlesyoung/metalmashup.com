nothing to me if only I may finish<br>
the race and complete the task the<br>
Lord<br>
Jesus has given me.<br>
The task of testifying to the<br>
Gospel of<br>
God's grace.<br>
Now I know that none of you whom<br>
I have gone about preaching the<br>
Kingdom will ever see me again.<br>
Therefore I declare to you that I am innocent<br>
of the blood of all men for I have not hesitated<br>
to proclaim the whole will of<br>
God.<br>
Keep watch over yourselves and all the flock to which the<br>
Holy<br>
Spirit has made you overseers.<br>
Be shepherds of the church, of<br>
God, which<br>
He bought with<br>
His own blood. I know that when I leave savage<br>
wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock.<br>
Even from your own number men will arise and<br>
distort the truth in order to draw away disciples after them.<br>
So be on your guard.<br>
We are not the wolves at the gate, we are the ones who face them.</p>

Though different endings, in His light or in His wrath<br>
We never know what awaits<br>
For every loved one lost I see the pain in every heart<br>
And still we all must pay the cost our sin has kept us apart<br>
<br>
So you've got the world<br>
Gripping your life in your hands<br>
Taking for granted the breath in your lungs<br>
But death has a voice<br>
Singing to us "Make your stand!"<br>
Death is ever certain we all share this fate<br>
I watched you go away (Know it was coming)<br>
Vanished and we didn't know it (We didn't know it)<br>
I sat and watched and prayed (We didn't know it)<br>
God has called your name (We didn't know it)<br>
<br>
In death we see that we are just as vapors<br>
And life has become what we all do savor<br>
When all is lost and taken away<br>
Endless nights to weep and pray<br>
We're letting it all out and it feels so quiet<br>
<br>
For every loved one lost I see the pain in every heart<br>
And still we all must pay the cost our sin has kept us apart<br>
Still in these bodies feeling fragile with the same fate<br>
Never knowing if our time fills or death awaits<br>
While our hearts are pounding inside we'll fight and not break<br>
To my King I will confide my everything<br>
<br>
In death we see that we are just as vapors<br>
And life has become what we all do savor<br>
When all is lost and taken away<br>
Endless nights to weep and pray<br>
We're letting it all out and it feels so quiet<br>

Still I'll walk Your path for You write my story<br>
And I'll count the days till I see Your glory<br>
Still I'll walk Your path for You write my story<br>
And I'll count the days till I see Your glory<br>
<br>
You will clothe us in spotless white<br>
I'll sing to Your glories, what a beautiful sight<br>
A host of saints and all the angels<br>
With no constraints and nothing painful<br>
We'll sing these songs and You will listen<br>

While this ship submerges on my tempest soul<br>

You know the next one could be much stronger<br>
And I can see the shoreline<br>
Is a mirage or a sign?<br>
I can feel the anchor fast as I meet each sudden blast<br>
And the cable though unseen bears the heavy strain between<br>
Each storm I safely ride until the turning of the tide<br>
As I meet each sudden blast<br>

We drop the anchor with the hope we won't set sail into the storm<br>
We set the sails and tie the rope tonight my son, be still and sleep<br>

My anchor holds until this tempest calms and dies<br>
For this squall's the throne to which He rides<br>
Still this faith will last the waves demise<br>
All these purging skies will never see my end<br>

We drop the anchor with the hope we won't set sail into the storm<br>
We set the sails and tie the rope tonight my son, be still and sleep<br>

So from as far as I've seen there is a great hoard against me<br>
Because I am a man sights see targets on my back<br>

Where is the wise man? Where is the scholar?<br>

        <p class="lyrics-test-test">I saw these chains locked on my wrists<br>
Around my neck no shackles missed<br>
I'd tried to shake them off and flee<br>
Nowhere to go without a key<br>
<br>
Awoke my eyes drew the first breath<br>
New to the world but not to death<br>
This plan devised in secrecy<br>
May take my life or set me free<br>
No more to work this simple life<br>
To toil only met with strife<br>
The evening still and passed the sun<br>
The night crept in my chance to run<br>
<br>
I wait for dark!<br>
I wait for dark!<br>
I wait for dark!<br>
No looking back I'm running<br>
I'm running out of sight<br>
I wait for dark!<br>
No looking back I'm running<br>
Running into the night<br>
I wait for dark!<br>
<br>
My feet be quick for this racing heart<br>
Come morning's light will the chasing start<br>
With the fear of pursuit comes a fear of the flight<br>
And if I stop they will shoot so I continue to hide<br>
In the cover of the night<br>
<br>
The morning bright all darkness gone<br>
I see the distance fade<br>
I take to flight my fears withdraw<br>
My heart is now betrayed<br>
<br>
Not a slave to man anymore!<br>
Not a slave to...<br>
<br>
Set me free<br>
Set me free<br>
Hammer these chains and<br>
Set me free!<br>
<br>
Break these chains<br>
Break these chains<br>
Unbind my hands and<br>
Pardon me!<br>
<br>
Ran all this way with the hope this pain would<br>
Now release<br>
Finally cease<br>
What is this freedom if I haven't<br>
Haven't peace<br>
Haven't peace?<br>
<br>
Serpent you lied and told me to run<br>
I haven't found repose for I still am undone<br>
This isn't life!<br>
This can't be it!<br>
<br>
I've run so far away yet<br>
None of the pieces will fit<br>
I couldn't see<br>
I should have known<br>
<br>
This peace abounds at my master's home<br>
Now my heart be still or these feet will fall<br>
All for the will of the master's call<br>
<br>
The morning bright all darkness gone<br>
And not afraid<br>
Shown the true light against the dawn<br>
My debt has now been paid<br>
I was lost to save<br>
For I'm the master's slave<br>
<br>
For I was lost to save<br>
<br>
No looking back I'm running<br>
Running with all my might<br>
No looking back I'm running<br>
Running to the true light<br>
<br>
I saw these chains fall to my feet<br>
I stand amazed at this work complete<br>
These chains not Yours, they were my own<br>

Slept through the coldest of nights and still it won't stop me<br>
From ever calling You "king"<br>
Or hide the Gospel we bring<br>
It's burning bright in my eyes<br>
Come grow, come grow and light up the skies<br>

We're hungry, tired, and sick<br>
Faced with resistance on every end (in You we hide)<br>
I've felt the scorn you inflict<br>
Attack this mission I will defend<br>
Still onward we will ride<br>
We will ride<br>
Onward we will ride<br>
Forward with no end in sight<br>
In You we shall hide<br>
Our hope is found in the light<br>

Tonight I rest, I rest in peace<br>

And I haven't a thirst for wealth or man's empty praise<br>

And Your grace has flowed in us completely<br>

Walked the streets a man unknown<br>
Battered face as He adorns<br>
A mocker's robe, a crown of thorns<br>
A tree designed for His demise<br>
Cursed, maligned by guilty cries<br>
The nails and hammer they did meet<br>
Two in the hands, one in the feet<br>
Risen up, put on display<br>
For a guilty mob to scream and say<br>
"Crucify! Crucify!"<br>
The people yelled to crucify<br>
"He must die! He must die!"<br>
Without a fight He did comply<br>
<br>
I do not know the pain you felt<br>
Or lowly service as You knelt<br>
Down before such lowly men You served (and washed their feet)<br>
Who is this man they sent to die?<br>
Many still could not reply<br>
Betrayed and sold by His very own (with a kiss)<br>
He met the needs of thousands fed<br>
Healed the sick and raised the dead<br>
"My God! My God!" The man did say<br>
"Have you forsaken me this day?"<br>
Bleeding, dying; words were few<br>
"Forgive them Lord for what they do"<br>
Gasping breath they heard Him say<br>
"It is finished!"<br>
<br>
Laid below the ground You knew it couldn't hold You<br>
They thought that You were bound by nature's laws<br>
He is risen! He is risen!<br>
For the veil that was torn in two and the darkness that would ensue<br>
A symbol alas that the debt was finally paid<br>
When the stone was rolled away, He was no longer where He lay<br>
Surely our King had risen from the dead<br>
<br>
On and on and on we're singing<br>
Singing out for all to hear us<br>

It’s just a single feather dear, it won’t be the end.<br>
Watch and you’ll learn young one, I’m not what you think.<br>
I’ll give you all you’d ever want, to eat and to drink.<br>

It’s too far to run. It’s too hard to fly.<br>
There’s got to be a better way<br>
It’s too far to run. It’s too hard to fly.<br>

One was the deal before but now I want three.<br>
So if you want to get your fix you’ll have to agree.<br>
Don’t you fret now, don’t you fear, you’ve still got much to give.<br>
I’ll keep my word if you keep yours; you still need me to live.<br>

No one will listen, hear out your voice.<br>
You’re lost and accursed,<br>
(Lost and accursed)<br>
You’re dying of thirst.<br>
(Dying of thirst)<br>
Stop with your fighting, I’m all you’ve got.<br>
None hear your crying, You’re hooked and caught.<br>
Was three, now it’s six.<br>
(Was three, now it’s six.)<br>
Come get your fix.<br>
(Come get your fix.)<br>

I’m too scared to run.<br>
I’m too nerved to fly.<br>

I once was friend but now the prey.<br>
I’m too scared to run.<br>

“Submit yourself to God. Resist the devil and He<br>
will flee from you. Draw near to God and He will<br>
draw near to you. Cleanse your hands,<br>
you sinners, and purify your hearts.”<br>

It’s the last time that you’ll get me.<br>
It’s the last time that you’ll get me.<br>
It’s your last one so now I’m free.<br>
It’s your last one so now I’m free.<br>

Whenever he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature,<br>

No! You deceptive and lying thief.<br>

Speak your reply, what shall be done for them? Draw out your path<br>
No one can contain the power and depths of my abundant love<br>

Oh how I cried aloud<br>
Though no one heard a sound<br>
How I was locked and chained<br>
But none could see me bound<br>
<br>
For I spoke of peace<br>
But I dreamt of war<br>
<br>
Secrets have a voice<br>
Screaming without breath<br>
My heart speaks of its choice<br>
Calling for my death<br>
<br>
Mountains take flight, rain down from above<br>
Shadows and night aren't dark enough<br>
Rocks and hills, cover me!<br>
Rocks and hills, hide me from your face!<br>
Rocks and hills, hide me!<br>
<br>
I claimed to be rich<br>
Truly, I was poor<br>
<br>
Secrets have a voice<br>
Screaming without breath<br>
My heart speaks of its choice<br>
Calling for my death<br>
<br>
Choosing my own path<br>
Shrouded treachery<br>
Ignore the aftermath, living carelessly<br>
Tempting you to wrath with infidelity<br>
<br>
So where's the fire? Where's the flood?<br>
These guilty hands are covered in blood<br>
Shouldn't I die, shouldn't I die, when your laws I deny?<br>
<br>
Earth heeds not my cries<br>
Mercy come or I die<br>
<br>
You speak with your own voice<br>
"Come be not afraid<br>
Weep no more rejoice<br>
Punishment is paid?"<br>
<br>
I feared the one who bears all sin<br>
Will you take me in father?<br>
Cover me with your blood!<br>
Cover me with your blood!<br>
Cover me!</p>

            <h1 id="ff6" class="lyrics-test">-Fountain-</h1>
            <p class="lyrics-test-test">here is a fountain filled with<br>
blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins<br>
And sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains<br>
<br>
Lose all their guilty stains<br>
Lose all their guilty stains<br>
Lose all their guilty stains<br>
Lose all their guilty stains<br>
<br>
The dying thief rejoiced to see that fountain in his day<br>
And there have I, though vile as he, washed all my sins away<br>
With all my guilty stains<br>
<br>
Wash all my sins away<br>
Wash all my sins away<br>
Wash all my sins away<br>
Wash all my sins away<br>
<br>
Ever since by faith I saw the stream Your flowing wounds supplied<br>
Redeeming love has been my theme and shall be till I die</p>

sleeps (Listen close)<br>
Feel the earth toss and turn and weep (Hear its voice)<br>
A wearied ground opens up to roar (Hear it roar)<br>
"How much longer will this pain endure?"<br>
<br>
We're waiting for a better day<br>
The shadows gone, all things pass away<br>
Listen close and hear it say<br>
"We're cursed and we're dying"<br>
<br>
Hills shake and mountains quake (Mountains shaking)<br>
Earth's fires have come awake<br>
No words, but hear it speak (Hear it speaking)<br>
As the deep calls to the deep<br>
<br>
Beauty, beauty mixed with dread<br>
Hanging by a thread<br>
<br>
We're waiting for a better day<br>
The shadows gone, all things pass away<br>
Listen close and hear it say<br>
"We're cursed and we're dying"<br>
<br>
Skies wake, the heavens ache (Heavens aching)<br>
Thunder and lightning break<br>
O glory come, come like a thief (Like a thief)<br>
Bring us relief from grief<br>
<br>
Still on and on, we're waiting for the hour<br>
On an on, our cries are growing louder<br>
<br>
How long must darkness reign in a world so violent (So violent)<br>
While we toss and turn in pain, in vain, and it's still so silent<br>
<br>
Waiting, wait for what's ahead<br>
These tattered rags will be shed<br>
<br>
We're waiting for a better day<br>
The shadows gone, all things pass away<br>
Listen and hear it say<br>
"We're cursed and we're dying"<br>
<br>
Hills shake and mountains quaking<br>
The earth's fires have now awaken<br>
No words, but hear it speak<br>
"We're cursed and we're dying"<br>
<br>
"We're cursed and we're dying"<br>
(We're cursed and we're dying)</p>

It speaks of only fiction that I could never trust<br>
Captured alive in this sinful estate<br>
Vexed am I to see I do the things that I hate<br>
Rip out the framework leave no stone unturned<br>
Until my heart forgets all that my flesh ever learned<br>
Tear down the structure till nothing is left<br>
God deliver me from this body of death<br>

O wretched man, wretched man that I am<br>
Lowly man, who can save such a wretch that I am?<br>
Who can save such a man?<br>
O wretched man, wretched man that I am<br>
Lowly man, who can save such a wretch that I am?<br>
Who can save such a man?<br>

In light of this truth: "There is no good in me"<br>
It causes all my soul to long for liberty<br>
Be freed from my lies of death, spared from the shame<br>
No more this sinner's breath forsaking your name<br>
<br>
I will be free<br>
I will be free<br>
I will, I will be free<br>

Freed from my lies of death, spared from the shame<br>

Barely alive, but who'd believe it<br>
I bear a heart of stone<br>
Yeah<br>
<br>
I look alive but the inside is something worse<br>
Fooling all with the right deeds and nice words<br>
I'm feeding lies and my heart doesn't feel the remorse<br>
Fooling all with the rights deeds and nice words<br>
<br>
Buried alive, but who could see it?<br>
My heart is numb but I'm just in denial<br>
Buried alive, but who could see it?<br>
I wear a dead man's bones<br>
<br>
Don't be nervous to face the truth that<br>
you're not fine, you never were<br>
So don't be frightened to see the Light<br>
when you open up your eyes<br>
<br>
Washed in the blood or just in the water?<br>
Oh how white you have washed your tomb<br>
Washed in the blood or just in the water?<br>
Hiding death inside its womb<br>

When you open up your eyes, you'll find that you're lost as hell<br>
When you open up your eyes, don't fear you'll be fine<br>
<br>
When your words touched my heart<br>
(You opened up my eyes)<br>
It ripped straight through my bones and tore my pride apart<br>
I spoke not a word (And death inside me dies)<br>
For the claims I had made were revealed to be absurd<br>
<br>
When you opened up my eyes I was shaking and trembling<br>
Then you told me to "Arise! Don't fear you'll be fine"<br>

Don't be nervous to face the truth<br>

In all that you were, but you bailed, you bailed<br>
I know who you are, you wanted to be worth it<br>
In all that you were, but you failed, you failed<br>
<br>
Kill all the lights, you fear what's inside<br>
Cover your eyes, I'm trying to run and to hide in shadows<br>
Filling the void with just a veneer<br>
Watching your steps and hoping that I don't come near<br>
Don't follow<br>
<br>
I know you thought, you thought you'd never need it<br>
But you cannot hide behind all your claims, your claims<br>
Guilt is now the anchor pulling, dragging your head under<br>
<br>
Drowning deeper down below<br>
Fear is just a false claim, vanity has locked the irons<br>
Sinking faster, heart is hollow<br>
<br>
Show me your sorrow my love<br>
This burden is the milestone 'round your neck<br>
Convalesce and I will bear, bear your shame<br>
<br>
The voice of hell screams and roars<br>
Of what has been done<br>
Tens of thousands and countless more<br>
Yet I'll remember not one<br>
You know who I am, I wanted to be perfect<br>
In all that I am, but I failed, I failed<br>
<br>
Would you walk in darkness just to find a broken rebel?<br>
Crippled legs won't find their way<br>
Could you look upon my blackened soul<br>
I've wrecked and ruined<br>
How could see me without clean hands or a pure heart?<br>
<br>
Show me your sorrow my love<br>
This burden is the milestone 'round your neck<br>
Convalesce and I will bear, bear your shame, every stain<br>
Bear your shame, every stain</p>

With the strongest of words, but weakest desire<br>

But look at me now, I'm reaching much higher<br>
I'm trying so hard, but quickly I tire<br>
(When will it be enough?)<br>
<br>
So often I see your beauty surrounding me<br>
(But find my way out)<br>
What's wrong with my heart? This friction of bound and free<br>
(That fills light with doubt)<br>
When will it be enough to know just grace and stop chasing the wind?<br>
(Stop chasing the wind)<br>
<br>
I tried to be wise with foolish volition<br>
(Working to earn my place)<br>
Oh how I was bold, but ignored my condition<br>
(Forgetting "all of grace")<br>

I feel the push and the pulls as it all tears me apart<br>
I'm tripping over my pride, what's wrong with my heart?<br>

Yet how could this be? I've been such a liar<br>
Who's got nothing to give and none you require<br>
<br>
How could I forget? Your ways are much higher<br>
(I couldn't afford mercy)<br>
Declaring to me your love doesn't tire<br>
(You must be everything)<br>
<br>
You've taken my curse and all that I've squandered<br>
(There's nothing that I could bring)<br>
That despite all my flaws and how far I've wandered<br>

a voice calling to me had said<br>
"Sail into the harbor, cast down your nets and follow Me"<br>
First of all the chosen, I saw the raising of the dead<br>
It must be my devotion, for I stood alone upon that sea<br>
<br>
So I walked on the tempest, I saw the waves below my feet<br>
It's clear I was the bravest, to meet the stranger on the deep<br>
<br>
I am the rock on which to build this land<br>
Got the keys to the kingdom, I'm at His right hand<br>
I was the first among the chosen, the boldest in devotion<br>
Walking out upon the ocean, what else could I need?<br>
<br>
I'm well-versed in forgiveness, as many as seven times repeat<br>
In service was I fearless; attack my king, my blade you'd reap<br>
<br>
What else could I need?<br>
What else could I need?<br>
<br>
Haunting my reflection, a bitter thought comes to my mind<br>
I made known my objection, about how you had come to die<br>
<br>
You said my thoughts were of the devil's kind<br>
I was opposed to your kingdom, and I should get behind<br>
But you were talking like you're cursed,<br>
already laying in your deathbed<br>
Maybe somehow you were mislead, may it never be!<br>
<br>
You said I would fall away, before the rooster's crow would end<br>
To my shame did I betray, deny you as my closest friend<br>
<br>
I'm singing, heart is hardened<br>
I'm sleeping in the garden<br>
I'm swinging swords I'm guarding my kingdom and my stardom<br>
<br>
Am I different than Judas? For I betrayed the kindest friend<br>
I'm all out of excuses, with nothing to make my amends<br>
<br>
O love! O love! O love!<br>
You bottomless abyss!<br>
O love! O love! O love!<br>
You bottomless abyss!<br>
<br>
How tender you had spoken, though I betrayed the kindest friend<br>
Faithful in devotion, such love I cannot comprehend<br>
<br>
Oh when you found me I was broken<br>
From the words that I had spoken<br>
But you were faithful in devotion<br>
You remembered me!<br>
You remembered me!</p>

The air was filled with morning's smoke<br>
The hours fly by so I work<br>
There's bound to be wealth in this dirt<br>
The heart of the earth holds the key<br>
Where all my troubles will flee<br>
<br>
So I dig, and I dig, and I dig<br>
Cause I can't find another way, I'll dig<br>
<br>
You say that you are dying to live<br>
(But at this pace your life you'll give)<br>
Death always gets the best of us<br>
(And then abandons to the dust)<br>
Your work and toil leave only room<br>
(For coffins, graves, and deathly tombs)<br>
Your work and toil leave only room<br>
(For coffins, graves, and deathly tombs)<br>
<br>
Dig, and you dig, and you dig, and you dig<br>
And you must see my friend there's another way<br>
<br>
I'll capture this life in my cold hands<br>
I'll make it fulfill all my demands<br>
I'll rip from the earth, the treasures it will bring<br>
And crown myself as a conquering king<br>
<br>
Tell me now what you have found<br>
Digging in the earth's cold ground<br>
Working with such vigor<br>
It's all foul and bitter<br>
Tell me now what you have found<br>
Digging in the earth's cold ground<br>
Working with such vigor<br>
All I see a grave digger<br>
<br>
So you spoke, and all that you said was a joke<br>
On all of your words you will choke<br>
You told me "I'm so very lost, and that I could have joy without cost"<br>
So I'll dig, and I'll dig, and I'll dig, and I'll dig<br>
Cause I don't really care what you say, I'll dig<br>
<br>
A haunting voice demands and craves<br>
(That in its depths a body lays)<br>
I feel its cry inside my soul<br>
("That I could never fill this hole")<br>
My work and toil leave only room<br>
(For coffins, graves, and deathly tombs)<br>
My work and toil leave only room<br>
(For coffins, graves, and deathly tombs)<br>
<br>
My pride wrapped me tight and it laid me down to sleep<br>
Telling me all that I build and find I keep<br>
All that I made was a terrible cold grave<br>
In death here I laid is there any way to save my soul?<br>
<br>
Dig, and I dig, and I dig<br>
Dig, and I dig, and I dig<br>
Will my body fill this grave?<br>
<br>
Tell me now what you have found<br>
Digging in the earth's cold ground<br>
Working with such vigor<br>
It's all foul and bitter<br>
Tell me now what you have found<br>
Digging in the earth's cold ground<br>
Working with such vigor<br>
All I see a grave digger<br>
<br>
How wondrous the sight that had caused these eyes to weep<br>
All of my death and hell you would bear and reap<br>
Though all that I made was a terrible cold grave<br>
In death there you laid, for you took my place to save my soul<br>
To save my soul<br>
To save my soul<br>
To save my soul</p>
