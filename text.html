      <p class="lyrics-test-test">Man, born<br>
Locked down by water<br>
Hear the rustle spat out from the corner<br>
As we are thrown<br>
Right into the arms of the sea<br>
<br>
Sheer bliss<br>
The dense cold collides<br>
The cliffs loomed up in the distance<br>
As they exhale, inhale<br>
<br>
We must be born anew<br>
To paint our portraits like the way we are<br>
We must learn to breathe again<br>
To reach the core of patterns in our souls<br>
<br>
Maybe we are something we are not<br>
It gives us a reason to be<br>
The spine of our soulless approach<br>
That gives us a reason to die<br>
<br>
Grand your light to the sun<br>
And turn your back on the shells<br>
At the shores, the sea<br>
<br>
Sow your seeds into the soil<br>
And recall the ideas that we shared<br>
In the years that we spent to progress<br>
<br>
Oversee to be free, mesmerize<br>
And try to embrace the arms that come forth<br>
By the days of resurgence stream<br>
<br>
Change me<br>
Drain all blood from the wounds<br>
And sleep your woes, slumbering<br>
Shed your skin and swim<br>
Right into the arms of the sea<br>
<br>
The waves lifting, rising from the oceans<br>
The undertow breaths again<br>
As we are thrown<br>
Right into the arms of the sea<br>
<br>
The dense cold collides<br>
The cliffs loomed up in the distance<br>
As they exhale, inhale<br>
<br>
Maybe we are something we are not<br>
That gives us a reason to be<br>
The spine of our mental approach<br>
That gives us a reason to live</p>

      <p class="lyrics-test-test">The wind, it unfolds me<br>
It takes me to the fields of no conceit<br>
A thousand piercing voices<br>
Cutting through the white noise as it<br>
Drains me for I am<br>
Merely a cloud that is drifting<br>
By the trail of raindrops<br>
Falling on their frozen faces<br>
<br>
Something inside<br>
That stops bleeding from my eyes<br>
My eyes ache from outside<br>
I must resist<br>
<br>
My flesh is weak<br>
This spoken word that guides my blood<br>
Sipping through the noise<br>
Approaching like<br>
Black horses stampede<br>
<br>
My heart beats with sorrow<br>
It cries and fades away<br>
Find me a way to pull through<br>
To obey my reason<br>
<br>
For the times that I came to the point that I couldn't believe<br>
Chasing the waves of decay<br>
I will follow the path to release<br>
There is nothing that is holding me down<br>
<br>
I can feel it is time to leave<br>
Voices speak and echo in<br>
Empty beds of a salted sea<br>
Unfolding winds ongoing<br>
<br>
As I stare through the windows I have been drawn by the myth of the pure<br>
No fear, it takes me on the winds of unknowing<br>
<br>
Like fallout through fire I will dance on the wire<br>
Which will lead me to legends that we all so admire<br>
As we crave for the future I speak my desires<br>
So these tormenting thoughts will commit suicide

Never had to look under water<br>
Has it been ruled<br>
The never ending current pulls me through<br>
Waiting, waiting<br>
How is has been flowing since I was a boy<br>
Swimming, lightning<br>
Coming home, I am going home<br>
<br>
Wash it all away, end up strong<br>
These eye have grown, these eyes have shown<br>
Watching the horizon, hoping for<br>
The cliffs to rise above the shore<br>
<br>
The tide rises far above<br>
The sky fades into the sea<br>
The awareness slowly ebbs away<br>
As light surely will find me<br>
<br>
As calm as inside a womb<br>
As the skies are filled<br>
With shades of gloom<br>
The watchers of time have foretold<br>
That this life will find its way back home<br>
<br>
Even a man who fights the cold<br>
Fears the depths of his own soul<br>
Under the stars that share his light<br>
Sinking slow and reaching home</p>

Could I see it coming - consuming all of me<br>
It is time to decide - this is right where I stand<br>

Could I just read the rhymes until I feel nothing more<br>
Then it tends to be so easily - I will fade<br>
<br>
These nerve-stretching seizures - phlegmatic to the physics<br>
A desecration to the intellect<br>
They are preaching their aesthetics<br>
<br>
Waiting for this moment to redirect the pain<br>
To make the forecast be compromising for<br>
Parading int his pitch-black vulturous scene I will break<br>
The oath of all restraint<br>
<br>
Dream, before the time arrives<br>
The earth will awake - anxious state of mind<br>
Leaving this body motionless<br>
<br>
Turning black once more - the eyes are wide open<br>
<br>
"The great black yonder<br>
Is pelting icicles upon my nerves<br>
I melt them to rain<br>
The water that flows out of the horizon<br>
A clammy sensation of my persistence"<br>
<br>
Casting the hunger for neurotic seizures<br>
Serving the syndrome<br>
<br>
Shedding the anger of everlasting darkness<br>
Feeding the illusion<br>
<br>
Despair is my own generous gesture to death<br>
<br>
Turning away from everything that is near<br>
Trying to fill the void that appears so clear<br>
<br>
A seismic shock, unleashing revolution<br>
Shedding skin, down drift exclamations<br>
Hypnagogic state, endless lucid dreaming<br>
Perpetual sleep, as we share the conclusion of<br>

Shedding the anger of everlasting darkness<br>
Feeding the illusion</p>

It is hiding him<br>
From he sounds of his mental state<br>

...And the rain pours down<br>
<br>
It is fair to say<br>
That he drifted<br>
On the salt of the open sea<br>
And the words that bleed in his mouth<br>
Carry him, drag him to the deep<br>
<br>
Heave your own arms<br>
Caught adrift<br>
Embrace the shade<br>
<br>
The drama is torn asunder<br>
Thus I fall inside my fate<br>
Waiting for the fever<br>
And I will sing to my crusade<br>
<br>
Between the barren and fruitful<br>
I got lost int he daily grind<br>
There is no way that supports my<br>
Dark conceptions to unwind<br>
<br>
I am the art for the people<br>
The apple of their crying eyes<br>
Missioner for the seeking<br>
Chewing their lives with contempt<br>
<br>
Like a storm front that he precedes<br>
It is the sound of the dreamer that screams<br>
Bashing clocks he had always wondered<br>
But never spoke of<br>
It is the strength, the weakness<br>
And the perfect in between<br>
<br>
Facing everything that he walked upon<br>
The eye had hurried by<br>
Compromising the smallest<br>
Fractions of a particle</p>

Before our eyes - we can't control<br>

Waiting to find<br>
Waiting here with nothing more to say<br>
Goodbye to all I have said<br>
Was waiting for decay<br>
Here I am, waving to the waves<br>
<br>
Catch the dream before we are<br>
Left inside and everything is gone<br>
Catch the dream before someone else is<br>
Setting forth an illusive state of war<br>
<br>
The shimmering flocks of shadows that<br>
Surround the walls we are looking at<br>
Mark of silence<br>
<br>
It tells me to hide<br>
It hides the divide<br>
Me versus man<br>
Bear the silence<br>

Tell me, mother: how can I turn back old times<br>
Maybe we are all asleep and die inside to taste<br>
The urge to feel so much more<br>
Closing all my windows to embrace<br>

"Our identities are stories<br>
With holes in their language<br>
Slumbering, at the height of what<br>
Could have been synchronicity or<br>
Parallels in multiple dimensions<br>

Can we find any reference<br>
In this abstract color field<br>
This ambivalence, this dualism<br>
Can we see the details of a bigger entity<br>
What is the antidote<br>
To the triviality of modern life"<br>

Find the words to completion<br>
Take me there, where I belong<br>
Fallen into harsh delusion<br>
Drawing circles to my illusion<br>
To reflect me and my diffusion<br>
Waves keep lashing down on the old shores<br>

Sunlight sails the soothing silence<br>

I am spitting letters<br>
Paraphrased in sand<br>
My words are set on fire</p>

Comfort is losing contrast in this light<br>
Ignorance eradicating<br>
This life draws to an end<br>

We need to find the strength to put the earth in motion<br>

Abundant rays, all light from the sun<br>

Gaze into the fire<br>
And the soothing winds<br>

In our eyes, in our nerves<br>
As our colors are fading out<br>
Just like birds in the storm<br>
So let the squall come, waking us<br>

Minor Earth, major skies<br>
The summit of the syntax of all life<br>
Is eroding along the path<br>
The great ocean road<br>
And its walls that always change<br>
Are still rising up<br>
The distribution of energy<br>
In dissonant directions<br>
A shift of paradigms<br>
Are these enough answers to our questions<br>
<br>
As we dive<br>
We might see a new dawn<br>
This life that carries on<br>
Promenading through the storm<br>
<br>
The everlasting chase<br>
The ways that seize the days<br>
Predicted to amaze<br>
Serenity will pave<br>
The inner state of grace<br>

Consciousness collides<br>
No permanence is ours</p>

      <p class="lyrics-test-test">I see the light<br>
So bright, overthrown<br>
The life of a Caesar will end<br>
Again, the mourning in his eyes<br>
Life will not feed on him<br>
<br>
Strong asthenia<br>
He trades his mind<br>
The answers he needs<br>
In the eye of the emperor<br>
Relinquish his fate<br>
Burying the beacon in time<br>
See, open my eyes and stare<br>
But who am I to focus them<br>
<br>
I see his mind burnt down<br>
The beauty of burden<br>
Do not underestimate the enemy's gaze<br>
The answers are there<br>
Life will not feed on him<br>

It is real<br>
Focus my eyes again<br>
But why should I open them<br>
Only when time collides<br>
Hide and the savior relents<br>
<br>
Now that everything is reclaimed<br>
And I don't own a thing<br>
Once, the life that has been led needs to be revised<br>
<br>
Every step along the way<br>
Has been a stone to bear<br>
Whether the path will still lead me<br>
Followed it will be<br>
<br>
There will be relief<br>
There will be light towards the end<br>
Strolling through the open fields<br>
And nothing will impend<br>
<br>
No more time to make amends<br>
The boundary here awaits<br>
Lingering with a head held high<br>
I face to seal my fate<br>
<br>
And here I stand alone<br>
For the fire took<br>
What had been revived<br>
Present time is over<br>
<br>
Now think, can you take this<br>
When everything is so pitiful<br>
Did you ever know<br>
It all could come down on you<br>
As one struggles to control<br>
Foreclosure ends before you know<br>
<br>
I feel the light<br>
I can feel it down on my skin<br>
Got to face the dark<br>
To survive in the light<br>
Let go of this world<br>
Take it down<br>
Bring it all down</p>

Waking up and see the dance around<br>
Of a broken harmony<br>
They are feeding off the winters<br>
In our heads<br>
Can't make us wondering<br>
For everything is much the same<br>
We are still being tied by<br>

Motionless, for we all know<br>
We shall burn, heavenless<br>

Elements of time<br>
Waking the yesterdays<br>

Statement to the old remorse<br>
Consolate, eat the flesh<br>

That is what it greeds<br>
Statement to the old remorse<br>
Contrition, harsh regret<br>
I can't take<br>

Waking the yesterdays<br>
Wading through the mind<br>
Waiting to escape the drifted sands<br>

Break the chain<br>

Elevation of the sewers<br>
The waking of the waters<br>
The heritage from the fathers<br>
To their daughters to renew us<br>

We are disciples<br>
We live our own way<br>
We are persuaders<br>
Defend our own space<br>

Keep it in your mind<br>
We are the same way</p>

And it's slowly breaking down the branches<br>

Breaking through negative energy<br>
Turn the flow forcing this gravity to its knees<br>

A crumbling statue decimates the posture<br>
Leaving but a shadow of the former self<br>
The eyes turning from crystal to blur<br>
Revealing but a fraction of the brightness they once had<br>

Spiraling further into the deep<br>
Losing grip tearing this soul away at the seams<br>

The descent continues<br>
As the ties to the surface grow thinner and thinner<br>

Sunken in deep slumber this silence soothes my thought<br>
There's no stronger connection to ourselves than to be alone<br>

Reflection of choices made under stress<br>

Off your shoulders<br>

Is all it takes to move forward<br>

Inattentive of what his actions composed<br>

        <h1 id="s7" class="lyrics-test">-The Fourth Prime-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Seven virtues<br>
And seven sins alike<br>
They represent our own creation<br>
Like seven man made wonders<br>
Glorious in concept<br>
<br>
Subjected to our own devastation<br>
We recognize occurrences<br>
And categorize our surroundings<br>
While giving meaning to words<br>
<br>
All conceived from the urge to understand<br>
And now used against those who don't<br>
<br>
The fourth prime has its story to tell<br>
So much meaning bestowed upon one number<br>
A single word<br>
All because the world has to make sense<br>
<br>
Seven fatal flaws<br>
Encouraged by seven continents<br>
Lived by through seven eras of time<br>
All leading to the downfall of man<br>
<br>
The question is not how but when?<br>
<br>
Signs of adaptation surround us in numbers<br>
Recognized and described by man-made words<br>
<br>
Endless theories of mutating evolving revolving spirals<br>
<br>
Cannot convince that change should be next in line<br>
Abiding the law of gravity<br>
<br>
Hovering into nothingness<br>
Accelerating down the scales of coexistence<br>
Beyond the point where no man lives for himself<br>
<br>
Seven fatal flaws<br>
Encouraged by seven continents<br>
Lived by through seven eras of time<br>
All leading to the downfall of man<br>
<br>
All conceived from the urge to understand<br>
And now used against those who don't<br>
<br>
The question is not how but when?<br>
<br>
Seven fatal flaws<br>
Encouraged by seven continents<br>
Lived by through seven eras of time<br>
All leading to the downfall of man<br>
<br>
The question is not how but when?

        <h1 id="s9" class="lyrics-test">-Timeless-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Last time I have discovered<br>
Roads to my loneliness<br>
<br>
An ocean divided<br>
Like red seas in fairy tales<br>
<br>
We're always running away<br>
Away from our deepest fears<br>
<br>
Hiding in shadows<br>
Until the path is clear<br>
<br>
Red seas in fairy tales<br>
<br>
Our path have crossed many times<br>
Last time I have discovered<br>
<br>
We run<br>
Hiding<br>
Until the path is clear<br>
<br>
I heard you crawling<br>
Carrying your burden<br>
Down the yearning hills<br>
We set a flame the beacons<br>
Envious whispers<br>
<br>
I heard you crawling<br>
Carrying your burden<br>
Down the yearning hills<br>
We set a flame the beacons<br>
Envious whispers<br>
Burning behind me<br>
<br>
I'm not keeping pace<br>
Straight forward focused eyes<br>
<br>
I'm not keeping pace<br>
A scorching, soothing fire's embra</p>
