Too sick and tired of the shame<br>
By my hand I break these god damned walls<br>
They will not forget my god damned name<br><br>

By my hand they will collapse<br>
By my hand the weak will be enslaved<br>
This is a tale of the foolish one<br>
He broke the bonds of a righteous man<br>
Now he must stay in eternal flames<br><br>

Taunted by demons, their voices so shrill.<br>

Exhume my mangled flesh and take me away from this death.<br><br>

Liberate me.<br>

Oh dear god, my eyes burned through my head.<br>
Why can I still see?<br><br>

Stop the flow of my beating heart,<br>
suck the air from my blackened lungs.<br>
And now you can see,<br>
what I came to be.<br>
You too will die,<br><br>
and forever burn with me.<br>
Burn with me.<br>
Make my soul cease to exist.<br>

Follow me to the depths.<br>

This is what i am<br>
So dark and cold a hollow soul<br>
So dark and cold i am alone<br><br>

The doors have been sealed shut<br>
To keep the secrets that lie within<br><br>
Through death's dark hollow I must<br>
fall to live in grave<br>

The horsemen set to make their ride.<br>

Now kneel before your sire.<br>

You are the warmth that I adore<br>

While we drink away our pain<br><br>

Why’d you let me drown?<br>

The only smile I seek comes from<br>
The bottom of the bottle I drink<br><br>

We did it for the fun<br>
We did it for the pain<br>
Waste away<br>
Let's drink until the sunlight<br>
Casts us all away<br><br>

To stop the bleeding<br>
Please someone take my hand<br>
My thoughts misleading<br>
The only demon I believe in is myself<br><br>

Can you hear me now?</p>

            <h1 id="ff11" class="lyrics-test">-Eternal Nightmare-</h1>
            <p class="lyrics-test-test">Welcome to your eternal nightmare<br>
My child, there is no other way<br>
Every sight you never wanted to see<br>
Everything you never wanted to be<br>
Closed eyes, but you can not erase<br>
Every sight you never wanted to see<br>
Everything you never wanted to be (to be)<br><br>

Welcome to your eternal nightmare<br>
Welcome to your eternal nightmare<br><br>

Come with me<br>
We’ll sink into the soil, beside the maggots<br>
All we need<br>
Inside the gnashing of teeth, under the static<br>
Now I can see all the misery<br>
I can feel the night closing in on me, closing in on me<br>
Now I can see all the misery<br>
Under my blood red veil in darkness we shall lay</p>

            <p class="footer-text article-margin">Here at Metal Mashup you will find a site that celebrates all things heavy and metal. Yet in an effort to move away from the more mainstream aspects of our scene, Metal Mashup has a much-needed focus on the more underground achievements of our community. Don’t get us wrong though, while we all love a bit of Metallica and still lose our shit every time Hetfield sneezes or Lars manages to keep time, we just feel that there is more to our clan that needs to be celebrated.</p>
