<br>
Memory is all that's left until we burn it down,<br>
These bones are wasting to dirt<br>
Your decision debased them to poison<br>
<br>
The finger points as the compass turns<br>
On your blood and on the source<br>
The finger points as the compass turns<br>
<br>
We will follow our eyes as our path is not clear<br>
We'll follow our eyes in search of life<br>
<br>
Will you take it again?<br>
Everything we have left?<br>
<br>
The finger points as the compass turns<br>
On the bones we built, watch as the crumble and burn<br>
<br>
We will follow our eyes as our path is not clear<br>
We'll follow our eyes in search of life<br>
<br>
We are, we are the grave beneath your feet<br>
We are, the poison that you drank<br>
<br>
We are, we are the grave beneath your feet<br>
When you chose to drink your poison<br>
You chose to leave us all behind<br>
<br>
When you chose to drink your poison<br>
You chose to die.</p>

      <p class="lyrics-test-test">Our minds are full of misconceptions,<br>
this place is one you'll never own<br>
So back the fuck off<br>

In our minds, our opinions, our impenetrable place of rest<br>
We are brainwashed by the media<br>
Every minute, every hour, every day.<br><br>

How much of the world has been untouched by eyes of the earth?<br>
How much of the world is there left to be burned?<br>

I'll bury my head to block out the sun.<br>

In our eyes, In our ears, its at the fucking door,<br>
The world of nature has been brought to it's demise.<br>

We have all broken like water upon rocks<br><br>

How much of the world has been untouched by eyes of the earth?<br>
How much of the world is there left to be burned?<br>

I'll move these mountains with the rage you've harvested<br>

I'll bury your head to block out the sun<br>

      <p class="lyrics-test-test">I perambulate through my forest<br>
Searching for the young and helpless who cowere in the night<br>
<br>
You can try and run but I will win this game<br>
<br>
I've been hear once before tonight<br>
These endless pages will be the death of me<br>

You can't escape, you cannot hide<br>
(Vocal glitches)<br>

You can't escape, you cannot hide<br>
You can only hope I'll make it quick and painless<br><br>

You can't escape, I'm lurking behind every step you make<br>

I am always watching, I'll never rest<br>
Until I have you in my arms<br>

You can try and run but I will win this game<br>

I've been hear once before tonight<br>
These endless pages will be the death of me<br><br>

I found you, You're fucking mine<br>

My face is white from the emptiness inside<br>
I'll fill this void of mine with your heart and soul<br>

Are you ready to die</p>

I find myself thinking back to where this all began<br>

It seems that im not good enough (good enough)<br>
It seems that im not good enough<br>

I walked this world in search of guidance<br><br>
And all I found was you<br>

Hiding in your, hiding in your lies<br>
(The truth is yet to come)<br>

But the truth and lies come with one heavy price<br>
What can I<br>
(What can I do to rectifiy this mess"<br><br>
This mess<br>
(This mess thw world has made of me)<br>
Made of me<br>

I can't stand the silence, wont you break the silence?<br>
I can't stand the silence... Bleh<br>
<br>
Break the silence, wont you break<br>
<br>
The truth and lies come with one heavy price<br>
What can I<br>
(What can I do to rectifiy this mess"<br>
This mess<br>
(This mess thw world has made of me)<br>

comedown off your poison breath;<br>
I was wrong to trust your forked tongue.<br>
<br>
How long have you been growing teeth?<br>
Long enough to feed your starving greed<br>
<br>
SO BLEED!<br>
<br>
So bleed your fucking lies and false love when I cut your paper skin.<br>

My heart would skip a beat with you around, I've learnt to deal with pain,<br>
I've learnt to face the fact.<br>
<br>
My heart would skip a beat if you would smile, but you won't.<br>
<br>
You are riddled with holes, broken nose, broken home<br>
Now there's nowhere to turn you should of just stayed at home.<br>
Look at me now, look in my eyes<br>
You have taken my sight, you've left me blind<br>
<br>
SO I'LL SHOOT YOU IN THE DARK!<br>
<br>
Hanging off your crucifix of broken bones and time you've spent<br>
Taking what you did not need<br>
<br>
FUCK YOU face the consequence... OH!<br>
<br>
My heart would skip a beat with you around, I've learnt to deal with pain,<br>
I've learnt to face the fact.<br>
<br>
My heart would skip a beat if you would smile, but you won't, Why won't you smile?<br>

You are cold with no thought for your self<br>
I wish you'd stay and be alive<br>
I am here, won't you just come home<br>
I wish you'd stay and be alive<br>
<br>
You taste like sweet black venom poison<br>
Like blood from a wound<br>
Black like malice and cold like a tomb<br>
And I know that I'm not perfect<br>
But you seem to breathe wounds<br>
You live for their creation and when<br>
you die they'll grow on your tomb...</p>

Wasted chances, lost and never found<br>
My heart is clenched like a fist, I am done<br>
The ground you walk on moves without me<br>
<br>
Where do we stand?<br>
<br>
Face to face with you, I can't tell where we stand<br>
Am I more than a burden?<br>

Hand in hand with you, I'm overwhelmed, I'm overwhelmed<br>
I can no longer love<br>
I've dealt with worse but this feels worse<br>
<br>
I can no longer love<br>
I've dealt with worse, you made this worse<br>

I found that love that I lost, it's filling up my chest<br>
My ribs are cracking under the pressure<br>
I want nothing less than the best for you<br>
Make up your fucking mind<br>

I want nothing less than the best for you<br>
So make up your mind<br>

Now that you've reached your hell I know you'll burn<br>
(Know you'll burn)<br>
After flooding your veins with gasoline<br>
I know that you'll burn<br>

Burn, blister, from the inside out<br>

But I know where you sleep<br>
You better bite your tongue, choke on your blood<br>

I am the voice at the back of your mind<br>
I am everything you left behind<br>

Lost inside the time spent crawling through my mind<br>
Searching for something to explain this<br><br>

I don't understand, it's something I can't grasp<br>
And now it feels like such a waste<br>
<br>
With blood so young in your skin<br>
<br>
Your memory will carry on, you are gone from our side but not from our lives<br>

I can't find a way to say goodbye, will you be alone?<br>
'Cos we have lost ourselves down here<br>

Lost down here<br>
<br>
Your tired eyes, these burdens keep you blind<br>
If only you had seen past the dark<br>

I can't move on by forgetting the past<br><br>
But my pain is my burden, and life goes on<br>

Life goes on, we have lost ourselves<br>

I can't find a way to say goodbye, will you be alone?<br>
'Cos we have lost ourselves down here<br>
