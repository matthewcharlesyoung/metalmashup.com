      <p class="lyrics-test-test">On a cold dark winter night hidden by the stormy light<br>
A battle rages for the right for what will become<br>
In the valley of the damned a warrior with sword in hand<br>
Travels fast across the land for freedom he rides<br>
<br>
And the sign from the master on high screams aloud and across hear the cry<br>
For the kingdom of fire and ice and the power to be alive<br>
Be strong ride on, carry on through the war<br>
Come along carry on, living for ever more<br>
<br>
On the wings of death by the hands of doom<br>
By the darkest light from the darkest moon<br>
Crossing silent seas over mountains high<br>
For we stand as one tonight<br>
<br>
On the black wind forever we ride on together<br>
Destroying your evil with freedom our guide<br>
When the master will storm us<br>
He'll stand high before us<br>
Our hearts filled with splendour<br>
Our swords will shine over the light<br>
<br>
In the valley of the damned<br>
Days breaks with golden strand<br>
Over pastures green it glows<br>
To where night returns<br>
<br>
In the shadows faces appear<br>
Warriors wearing full metal gear<br>
All join together one and all<br>
Before the glorious light<br>
<br>
Rise up, gather around<br>
Come and hear what is said<br>
Use your senses open your mind<br>
Don't you ever forget<br>
<br>
On the wings of life, by the hands of hope<br>
By the brightest light from the brightest sun<br>
Crossing silent seas over mountains high<br>
To the valley of the damned<br>
<br>
On the black wind forever we ride on together<br>
Destroying your evil with freedom our guide<br>
When the master will storm us<br>
He'll stand high before us<br>

Our swords will shine over the light<br>

With twisted tales of sacrifice<br>
To imagine or believe all the glory of the free<br>

Hunting all day an endless cry<br>
The things I've seen I can't deny<br>
Sinners, saints all mixed in one<br>
The dawn of time has begun<br>
<br>
Why can't you see what they're doing to me<br>
Is it fair that I'm dying in vain<br>

Once in a land of sacrifice now only valleys of demise<br>
Shadows of a pale blue moonlight ride the waves of entity<br>

Why can't you see what they're doing to thee<br>
Is it fair that you all die in vain<br>

Ride with the steel and the power of the sword<br>
Stand up and fight now and forever more<br>
Rise through the night sky with daylight's desire<br>
To be free there must be black fire<br>
<br>
Through the day and through the night with dragons heart the warrior strikes<br>
This is the day that they'll be known as my enemy<br>

Why can't you see what they're doing<br>
To what we believe in we rise through the pain<br>

Only visions of ice will remain<br>

No more dreams as the rivers run dry<br>

Only sorrow and sadness remains<br>

And the forces of darkness shall rise<br>

And the valleys echo with pain<br>

      <p class="lyrics-test-test">Outside on a winter's night as the rain begins to fall<br>
There's a chill in the air and the howl of a wolf while the rain beats at the door<br>
Seven kings will ride on the wind up towards the mountains high<br>
And the only sound that will break the air is the warrior's bitter cry<br>
<br>
When the dawn of a new day will see the light then the strongest hearts grow old<br>
And the warrior stands on top of the hill in the snow<br>
<br>
Dark night with a glimmering light in the distance up ahead<br>
In the forest they dwell with a misty spell no one heard what once was said<br>
And the eagle fly through the clouds while earth bleeds dark and cold<br>
When the voices of men will ring out again all creation shall unfold<br>
<br>
When the colour of night will fade to light and the weakest hearts go cold<br>
And the warrior stands on top of the hill in the snow<br>
<br>
And we're standing one and all fighting till we fall<br>
Hoping for a better day never giving in<br>
Until we find the words till we find the words to say<br>
Until we find the words to say<br>
<br>
Burning starfire shine in the sky<br>
For the lives of great men who stand by your side<br>
When the night fall on we will ride<br>
For no lost souls will live on forever<br>
<br>
Dark night on the valley below still the horsemen follow through<br>
It's a forest that leads to the foot of the hill that inside the magic holds<br>
Seven strong they ride on along to the place where sorrow lies<br>
And the shadows of the night will no longer hide all their mysteries come undone<br>
<br>
When the colour of night will fade to light and the weakest hearts go cold<br>
And the warrior stands on top of the hill in the snow<br>
<br>
And we're standing one and all fighting till we fall<br>
Hoping for a better day never giving in<br>
Until we find the words till we find the words to say<br>
Until we find the words to say<br>

Burning starfire shine in the sky<br>
For the lives of great men who stand by your side<br>
When the night fall on we will ride<br>
For no lost souls will live on forever<br>
<br>
And we're standing one and all fighting till we fall<br>
Hoping for a better day never giving in<br>
Until we find the words till we find the words to say<br>
Until we find the words to say<br>

Burning starfire shine in the sky<br>
For the lives of great men who stand by your side<br>
When the night fall on we will ride<br>
For no lost souls will live on forever<br>

For lost souls will live on forever...

<br>
Proud and so glorious standing before of us<br>
Our swords will shine bright in the sky<br>
When united we come to the land of the sun<br>
With the heart of a dragon we ride<br>
<br>
We are flying on wings in winter sky with fire burning deep inside<br>
We are warriors of endless time forever and on<br>
On the wings of steel an ancient flight we see the powers that unite<br>
The gods will now send us a sign of battle once more<br>
<br>
Through the valley we ride full of glory we soar<br>
Where the fights will be raging for now and for more<br>
When the trumpets will sound<br>
Lift your swords to the sky<br>
For tonight we will fight 'til we die<br>
<br>
Proud and so glorious standing before of us<br>
Our swords will shine bright in the sky<br>
When united we come to the land of the sun<br>
With the heart of a dragon we ride<br>
<br>
A land unknown we come so far<br>
We ride the night 'til morning star<br>
When colours fade to black and white<br>
Your eyes come to sight<br>
<br>
With the vision of a great divide<br>
You turn towards the other side<br>
You think you run but you can't hide<br>
The dead can not ride<br>
<br>
Through the valley we ride full of glory we soar<br>
Where the fights will be raging for now and for more<br>
When the trumpets will sound<br>
Lift your swords to the sky<br>
For tonight we will fight 'til we die<br>
<br>
Proud and so glorious standing before of us<br>
Our swords will shine bright in the sky<br>
When united we come to the land of the sun<br>
With the heart of a dragon we ride<br>
<br>
Over high seas and mountains<br>
We fly to the heavens on wings of a dragon tonight<br>
<br>
Proud and so glorious standing before of us<br>
Our swords will shine bright in the sky<br>
<br>
Proud and so glorious standing before of us<br>

        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Life is a misery, don't know how it's come to be<br>
Death, the epitome of all of our days<br>
In the past we had no choice to hear or to be the voice<br>
Close your eyes and visualize the demon to arise<br>
<br>
You know that sanity is not as it was meant to be<br>
And now that misery has taken a new stand<br>
In the land of a thousand souls we will carry on through the rain<br>
In the sun we will move along with the memories of the slain<br>
When I see this humanity and the evil that they have come to be<br>
We've come to the point of no return and you beg for just...<br>
<br>
One more time to escape from all this madness<br>
One more time to be set free from all this sadness<br>
And one last time to be the one who understands<br>
My soul and my spirit will go on, for all of eternity<br>
<br>
Foreign the currency, your payment in blood to be<br>
Death is the destiny for all of our ways<br>
In the dark you hide away for who or what you can't say<br>
When I see the power of the demon come alive<br>
<br>
You know that sanity is not as it was meant to be<br>
And now that misery has taken a new stand<br>
On the wings of eagles flying staring on to the sun<br>
Reaching for the gold horizon when the war shall be won<br>
Can you see the debauchery and the blade of death that has come for thee<br>
In winds of torment forever more you will cry for just...<br>
<br>
One more time to escape from all this madness<br>
One more time to be set free from all this sadness<br>
And one last time to be the one who understands<br>
My soul and my spirit will go on, for all of eternity</p>

Onwards through the ice and snow forever more<br>
Standing fighting full of hate the time has come now<br>
Stand and sound the guns of glory cry for war<br>

On wings of glory we will carry on<br>
Far across the forgotten lands toward the distant sun<br>
And in the darkness shining far beyond the starlight<br>
Lightning is striking from the dark dawning shadows<br>
And in the kingdom of the everlasting sun<br>

Spilling all the blood on the fires below<br>
Smashing through the boundaries with the fire and fury<br>
Killing all the mortals down the winding road<br>

Hell fires are raging the storm growing strong<br>
On the path to victory towards the distant sun<br>
And in the darkness shining far beyond the starlight<br>

In the land of loneliness the seas of blood run cold<br>
Is the feeling lost inside within the sins of all mankind?<br>
Time after time we stood united on we go<br>
<br>
Fly far away don't let the world pass you by<br>
Live for the day when we must stand and survive<br>
Now we face the judgment day our souls will feel the pain<br>
Hear the screams of my world through the rain<br>
<br>
Silent fields of despair my tears in the rain<br>
Pain in my heart bleeding through<br>
One day we'll be back for one moment in time<br>
Endlessly searching for you...<br>
<br>
Who can cure my emptiness inside for this time?<br>
Suffering from loneliness my dreams and hopes will die<br>
No more feelings left inside my blackened heart I cannot hide<br>
Time after time our souls divided on we cry<br>
<br>
Fly far away don't leave your own past behind<br>
Live for the day another year passes by<br>
Now we turn to face our fear there's nothing more to say<br>
Still your dreams and my nightmares remain<br>

Silent fields of despair my tears in the rain...</p>

Over mountains paved with gold and through the valleys of the slain<br>
Our quest will lead us onwards to the journey of the brave<br>
When the time has come to stand for the power we believe<br>
We will ring the sound of victory for one and all to see<br>

Silent tears of your hidden fears come to haunt you once again<br>
Fight on for the memories of the everlasting dream<br>

And the warriors who live forever fight on to the end<br>

Across the highest mountains and through the endless seas<br>
Our journey ever onwards fight until we all be free<br>
Through the darkness shining the never ending light<br>
On through the days of glory rise towards the fight<br>

And one day we will find a way toward this distant golden age<br>
The cries of war will sound the day<br>
We stand before the dawn of a new world<br>

On through the raging thunder across the seven seas<br>
Cold winter skies are falling on the battles we have seen<br>

Crossing battles savage seas towards the mountains high<br>
Forest plains of wilderness we're striking out tonight<br>
On towards our destiny we travel far and wide<br>
Journey through the darkness as your hearts refuse to die<br>
In the flames of hell we fire at will the fires of doom has come<br>
With the forces of the blackest knights they're staring at the sun<br>
Far across the distant plains of ice we're searching for the sword<br>
When the time has come for battle now we follow with the horde<br>

Sun will shine upon the lives of burning hearts of ice<br>
As you break through the boundaries of life this feeling of despair<br>
And they die in their sleep for the world that will not care<br>
You feel lost in this labyrinth of pain this sickening dismay<br>
There's a voice inside that's calling another wasted day<br>
<br>
Can't you see the history the suffocating madness<br>
In the land of fallen souls there's nowhere left no place to go<br>
I have traveled far and wide across this wasteland<br>
Still searching for the answers for the right to understand<br>

Burning fires burning lives on the long distant roads<br>
Through the lost mountains endless so far away from home<br>
Warrior soldiers forever we fought long ago<br>
We're all lost in the darkness so far away from home<br>
<br>
Riding through the starlight and smashing the<br>
boundaries as hellfire falls from the sky<br>
A shadow of pain will arise from the ashes of<br>
those fallen ones who have died<br>
Our only master with fire and fury of<br>

The sound of evil laughter falls around the world tonight<br>
<br>
Fighting hard, fighting on for the steel, through the wastelands evermore<br>
The scattered souls will feel the hell bodies wasted on the shores<br>
On the blackest plains in hell's domain, we watch them as we go<br>
In fire and pain, and once again we know<br>

On towards the wilderness our quest carries on<br>
Far beyond the sundown, far beyond the moonlight<br>
Deep inside our hearts and all our souls<br>

So far away we wait for the day<br>
For the lives all so wasted and gone<br>

Through the fire and the flames we carry on<br>

As the red day is dawning<br>
And the lightning cracks the sky<br>
We'll raise our hand to the heavens above<br>
With resentment in their eyes<br>
Running back from the mid-morning light<br>
With a burning in my heart<br>
We're banished from a time in a fallen land<br>
To a life beyond the stars<br>

In your darkest dreams see to believe<br>
Our destiny is time<br>
And endlessly we'll all be free tonight<br>

And on the wings of a dream, so far beyond reality<br>
All alone in desperation, now the time has come<br>
Lost inside you'll never find, lost within my own mind<br>
Day after day this misery must go on<br>

Now here we stand with their blood on our hands<br>
We fought so hard now can we understand<br>
I'll break the seal of this curse if I possibly can<br>

Stand before the storm as the last horizon falls<br>

For today the everlasting eternal sun<br>

Here alone the fight to breathe still searching for the truth to be<br>
Blackened by the burning fire held deep inside my mind!<br>
<br>
Far beyond the lost horizon standing on the shore<br>
Across the seas their hearts will bleed this life we're waiting for<br>
Taste the steel in pain you kneel for glory we defend<br>
Our fallen souls will rise to fight again!<br>

Stay here with me this night we'll be together<br>
Future in our hands we'll fight with freedom drawing near<br>
Stand here with me for we will live forever<br>
Tonight we stand and face it all<br>

Falling rain will hide the pain that lies beneath the burning flames<br>
All hope is gone so carry on before the world will fall<br>
Rise again to die in vain now life can never be the same<br>
Our own salvation drawing nearer hear the darkness call<br>

Skies are falling thunder storming stand before the world<br>
We're banished now to barren wastelands fight the demon whore<br>
Riding on through blackened darkness cross the endless sands<br>
We sail away our victory at hand!<br>
<br>
Stay here with me together we'll be stronger<br>
Side by side we've conquered lands and stormed across the seas<br>

Die here with me we feel this pain no longer<br>
For now and ever we will be<br>

Fly across the mountains and towards the distant sun<br>

Feel the breakdown of my body - set me free<br>

The sign of the warriors, the evil will rise<br>

Through the fire and the flames, breaking the chains<br>

Torment and pain trample the slain<br>
Soldiers of death we know<br>

Fly free for what we believe<br>

Feel me the touch we all need<br>
So silently now we will kneel<br>
Cry for eternity<br>

See now the fallen will live again<br>
They feel the pain burn inside of them<br>
Remember now what you feel again deep down inside<br>
Still cursing still crawling we're endlessly falling<br>
The downfall of mankind the fate of us all<br>

Hold your hands to the sky bleed and you cry<br>
Screaming until we know<br>
Dying in pain again and again<br>
Onwards to hell below<br>

Stand strong we'll live together raging through the barren lands<br>
Our eyes have seen the sorrow far across the sands<br>
The power in our hands<br>

Fly far away to the end of our days<br>
The voices of long distant cries<br>
Now we remain in this labyrinth of pain<br>

And through the blackest darkness<br>
Stars above shining bright<br>
<br>
Through the sun and winter rain will fall<br>

Stare at life through eyes of mine<br>
the hate the fear and the pain<br>
There's a feeling held deep inside - when life you live is in vain<br>

Fly away down the lonely roads of yesterday<br>
We close your eyes to see the light of brighter days<br>
And all alone we'll be where time can never heal<br>
With the trail of broken hearts flying free<br>

Once again we walk this lonely road<br>
There are times that we are wading through the rain and cold<br>
We're lost in memories of what we left behind<br>
Relive the dreams, the endless screams of pain inside<br>
<br>
Lives are filled with emptiness<br>
The fear returned once again<br>
Searching endlessly you cannot see<br>
Drown your mind in the pain<br>

The last temptation will be all that's left for me<br>

When I hear those lies you lie<br>
When I see your creation now falling down on me<br>

Struggle day by day<br>
But never retrieving<br>
Taking our chances<br>
And follow the footsteps<br>
Ancestors will take us to this fight<br>
At the time it was blistering snowing<br>
<br>
Never really know about<br>
Where we were going<br>
Time is coming now<br>
To cross over<br>
Here and now until<br>
The curtain lowers<br>

Slaying all the evil down below<br>
Onwards we ride now<br>
To what we know<br>
Strong enough to stay<br>
And carry on forever<br>
Brace your soul<br>
To fight whenever<br>

We will have our stand<br>
Across the deepest oceans<br>

For those who wait we can't deny<br>
Still the battle raging and the fire burns inside<br>

For the chaos ascending<br>

All times pretending<br>
Passing shades of darkness<br>
In the world around you<br>
Finally insanity<br>
In death has found you.<br>
<br>
On the edge of life<br>
Trying to pull you under<br>
Deep inside the storm<br>
There's a raging thunder<br>
Sacrifice your innocence<br>
For persecution<br>
As we now prepare<br>
For the revolution<br>
<br>
Slaying all the evil down below<br>
Onwards we ride now<br>
To what we know<br>
Strong enough to stay<br>
And carry on forever<br>
Brace your soul<br>
To fight whenever<br>

In a time of fire we're searching<br>
Blind inside the mind<br>
Run away to hell's damnation<br>
One day we will find<br>
Suddenly the skies are falling
Too late for us all<br>
Crashing down on all creation<br>
As the towers fall<br>

Take you with me, we will fly across the sea<br>
To the land of the sun where our journeys begun<br>

Twisted and so broken once again,<br>
And the promises we cast away will shine a guiding light,<br>
Victim of your grief and denial.<br>
<br>
Take my hand, this one last time,<br>
Face the world before us, the warrior inside,<br>
In a lifetime of disaster, it's a battle to the end,<br>
Final stand, my life must carry on,<br>
And forever, this time.<br>
<br>
Battered, beaten, forced to submission,<br>
Stricken by your fatal decision,<br>
Suddenly it's time to say your last goodbyes,<br>
Misery remains voluntary, all illusion gone,<br>
Break through the blistering madness,<br>
Free forever more.<br>
<br>
Blinded my eyes with your filtering mutation cast aside,<br>
I'll still be waiting tomorrow,<br>
Stand to a toxic man, forced to a life of yesterday,<br>
Theatre of salvation crushed and burned,<br>
Down this lonely road, recede the day our dreams are brushed,<br>
Can't regain this emptiness in time.<br>
<br>
See through the skies,<br>
Far beyond the road tonight,<br>
Here the sounds of freedom ring,<br>
In a silent dream, and a million miles away.<br>
<br>
See through the skies, far beyond our world tonight,<br>
Hear the sounds of freedom ring,<br>
In a silent dream,<br>
And a million miles away.<br>
<br>
Reach for the stars,<br>
And live our lives forever free,<br>
In our hearts for a thousand years,<br>
And a thousand lifetimes before.<br>
<br>
And the dawn of a new day will rise, a light for us all.

<br>
Eternal temptation, their eyes to the sky<br>
This nightmare is everywhere, my eyes open wide<br>
Crash on through troubled waters, oceans collide<br>
We stand alone until the end, we fight side by side<br>
<br>
Standing strong together, marching forever on<br>
Fire in the heavens, now that our time has come<br>
<br>
We feel the fire burning bright in the night<br>
Where the warrior lives and the warrior dies<br>
Wherever you go, we will be by your side<br>
For the Spirit of Ninja will carry the night<br>
<br>
The sky will turn black as nightfall appears<br>
The hatred surrounding, they hide in great fear<br>
The evil all around, the sound they will hear<br>
Will not be for long now, the time it is near<br>
<br>
Raising hell forever, still millenniums go by<br>
Fire in the heavens, bleeding ears hear the cry<br>
<br>
We feel the fire burning bright in the night<br>
Where the warrior lives and the warrior dies<br>
Wherever you go, we will be by your side<br>
For the Spirit of Ninja will carry the night<br>
<br>
Standing strong together, marching forever on<br>
Fire in the heavens, now that our time has come<br>
<br>
We feel the fire burning bright in the night<br>
Where the warrior lives and the warrior dies<br>
Wherever you go, we will be by your side<br>
For the Spirit of Ninja tonight<br>
<br>
We feel the fire burning bright in the night<br>
Where the warrior lives and the warrior dies<br>
Wherever you go, we will be by your side<br>
For the Spirit of Ninja will carry the night<br>
<br>
With the ninja forever, tonight!<br>

            <h1 id="ff10" class="lyrics-test">-Scars Of Yesterday-</h1>
            <p class="lyrics-test-test">[Special Edition Bonus Track]<br>
<br>
Suffer the raging anger creeping below<br>
Trapped in the circle, so helpless<br>
Forces beyond<br>
This is your last chance to die<br>
<br>
I hear a thousand voices screaming my name<br>
Dreams of a life forgotten now will be gone<br>
Never to return again<br>
<br>
Hide from the light, you feel so hypnotized<br>
Filtered and disguised<br>
Burning forever, try to remember<br>
Sadness in her eyes<br>
<br>
So many times now we've been here before<br>
No more illusions behind the open door<br>
Trapped within my fierce desire, resistance is futile<br>
Screaming for your life, nowhere to hide<br>
Tonight we cross the line, your innocence is mine<br>
<br>
Falling down, my life fading now to the end<br>
One last chance of glory in my heart again<br>
Set me free from craving the one thing I can't have inside of me<br>
But is it all a waste of time?<br>
<br>
Lost in a misery, the fatal demise<br>
Forced to a living that no one can understand<br>
Hiding behind all the lies<br>
<br>
A long time in slavery, it cries out in vain<br>
Lurking around the shadows until the end<br>
Fearless in fatal disguise<br>
<br>
Wake from the dream, the life you left behind<br>
Time to understand<br>
Lost in the laughter, life everafter<br>
Trials of a broken man<br>
<br>
And through this madness a new day will rise<br>
We shall remember the pain she held inside<br>
Fear the pain inside my heart, our sacrifice in vain<br>
Screaming for your life, nowhere to hide<br>
This everlasting strain, driving you insane<br>
<br>
Falling down, my life fading now to the end<br>
One last chance of glory in my heart again<br>
Set me free from craving the one thing I can't have inside of me<br>
But is it all a waste of time?<br>
<br>
Still lost in the universe, we cry for a new day to come<br>
Break free from our loneliness, the last time<br>
Pray tonight as we try to understand<br>
<br>
Falling down, my life fading now to the end<br>
I'm alive forever, my soul will ascend<br>
One last chance of glory in my heart again<br>
Set me free from this craving the one thing I can't have inside of me<br>
Just a memory<br>
Or is it all a waste of time?

            <p class="lyrics-test-test">[Japanese Bonus Track]<br>
<br>
In a lifetime of decay<br>
Sudden cry for yesterday,<br>
When the world will see the end of eternity<br>
Sacrifice before the dawn<br>
Of a child soon to be born<br>
Before the night too many tears we cried<br>
<br>
In a long forgotten land<br>
Through the silent raging pain<br>
Of the price to pay that awaits for me<br>
The end of all our destiny<br>
<br>
Don't close your eyes tonight<br>
For the lights beyond still shine towards a brighter day<br>
The time has come for us tread blood across the sands<br>
Carry on as the red rivers run<br>
<br>
And through the wilderness we feel the pouring rain<br>
In the silence ever searching on through the misery<br>
And all the promises we made and cried in vain<br>
Don't you take the time to realise the master of disguise?<br>
<br>
Blind my eyes burning forever to wash my sins away<br>
Out of the dark pain is the price<br>
Fly away out of the raging storm<br>
Lost within my memories<br>
Still haunting me<br>
A never ending story<br>
<br>
Far and wide forever on<br>
Stand before the world alone we journey to the other side<br>
Raise your hands to the sky<br>
Through the night and through the day<br>
Don't look back no time to pray<br>
The battle rages on marching on and on<br>
<br>
Don't cry for me tonight<br>
For the lights beyond will guide me home tomorrow<br>
The time will come for us the curse is growing strong<br>
Carry on with the rise of the sun<br>
<br>
So take me far away it's time to set me free<br>
All my life I have been waiting but I could never see<br>
Raising your hands to the sky<br>
Turning your eyes to the sun<br>
Pray for forgiveness<br>
The power to save has gone for the last time<br>
<br>
Blind my eyes burning forever to wash my sins away<br>
Out of the dark pain is the price<br>
Fly away out of the raging storm<br>
Lost within my memories<br>
Still haunting me<br>
A never ending story<br>
<br>
Blind my eyes burning forever to wash my sins away<br>
Out of the dark pain is the price<br>
Fly away out of the raging storm<br>
Lost within my memories<br>
Still haunting me<br>
A never ending story
