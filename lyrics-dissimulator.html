      <p class="lyrics-test-test">You’ve lulled yourself into complacency<br>
But the safety you feel is all in your head<br>
<br>
Step down from your pulpit<br>
Look and see the generation that you’ve left for dead<br>
Look and see the generation that you’ve left for dead<br>
<br>
Tear the veil from your eyes<br>
And see that this is a war of attrition<br>
No Father, tear the veil from their eyes<br>
Give me strength to light the flame that<br>
Will burn their world<br>
(Tear the veil from your eyes, and you<br>
will see the generation you have left for dead,<br>
you have chosen to sit and watch from the sidelines,<br>
you have forsaken your purpose.<br>
Everywhere I turn, my brothers,<br>
my sisters, all your children have closed their eyes,<br>
they have lost their focus,<br>
their hearts have grown cold,<br>
just say the word and I will light the flame that will burn their world)<br>
<br>
You have fought the battle and bear the scars<br>
And they turned you away cause you’re dangerous<br>
But look around, you are not alone<br>
You have fought the battles and bear the scars<br>
And they turned you away because you’re dangerous<br>
But look around, you are not alone<br>
We will live forever!<br>
Too many times have I seen someone come to you for guidance<br>
Only to find a congregation who have turned their backs<br>
Have you forgotten it’s not your place to turn his children away?<br>
You cast judgment on the scars that mark them<br>
<br>
YOU WILL BURN<br>

My heart is calling out to feel the warmth of my father (my father)<br>
Is it too much to ask for you to wake up?<br>
These scars on my face only remind me we live in a broken world<br>
We live in a broken world<br>
<br>
You threaten me with everything in your reach<br>
Can’t you see how pathetic you are?<br>
You spit in my face and you call me trash<br>
I look into your eyes and see nothing but anger<br>
I look into your eyes and see nothing but anger<br>
I can’t take it anymore<br>
I can’t take this anymore<br>
<br>
In this broken home I stand<br>
Staring at a blank wall that has been smashed in<br>
I feel as though I am looking into a mirror<br>
Of what’s inside of me, (of what’s inside of me)<br>
<br>
Running through the house I find myself running for my life<br>
Why can’t this just be a dream (why can’t this just be a dream)<br>
And when I think I’m safe you are right behind me<br>
Ready to strike me<br>
Daddy<br>
<br>
I wish I could run away, and never feel your hand again<br>
<br>
Oh no, daddy’s drunk again, and I’ve made a mess, why did I make a mess?<br>
I try to hide in my room but he calls me out, why is daddy so mad at me?<br>
I didn’t mean to upset you, I’m so sorry, please don’t hurt me<br>
I didn’t mean to upset you, I’m so sorry, please don’t hurt me<br>
<br>
As you run away into the dark, you fall on your knees, begging Father please<br>
Be the dad I never had<br>
Be the dad I never had<br>
<br>
In this broken home I stand<br>
Staring at a blank wall that has been smashed in<br>
I feel as though I am looking into a mirror<br>

Bullets forged by a malcontent cycle of life<br>
I’ve disfigured all within that’s beautiful<br>
<br>
I’m losing grip on all that’s real and I begin to lose my mind<br>
Where is my sanity?<br>
Where is my sanity?<br>
Running circles trapped inside a cage<br>
Will you release me?<br>
Oh God, release me!<br>

I was born with a gun to my head<br>

<br>
Some people are born into tragedy<br>
<br>
I need to find a way out of this hell<br>
Is this an oppression of the mind?<br>
Or maybe it’s something else<br>
<br>
I feel you creeping upon me<br>
Your claws digging deep in my skull<br>
I will fight you with the strength of the One who died for me<br>
<br>
I will fight<br>
I will fight<br>

He sends his demons in disguise<br>
But we will not be deceived<br>
They tear at our mind<br>
But we will rip out their throats<br>

I watched as the sky cracks open (burning red)<br>
I stare at the earth as it falls down around my head<br>
<br>
Here I stand, with a choice to make, golden fields behind, dark forest ahead<br>
I know I should turn away but it beckons me<br>
So into the forest I tread<br>
<br>
Running through this forest endless and dark<br>
Without a path to guide my way out<br>
They told me I would never make it out alive<br>
But I went in anyway; anyway, I couldn’t help myself<br>
<br>
Now I lay here, in a shrouded meadow<br>
The mist trailing across my skin<br>
Silently I watch as the forest closes in<br>
<br>
The darkness seeps into my mind as vines pull me from the ground<br>
And hold me fast<br>

Silent voices whisper from the shadows<br>
Their eyes glitter in the dark with perverse intent<br>
They told me in order to escape I must leave my souls behind<br>
And for escape I gave it willingly<br>
<br>
I DESCEND<br>
<br>
Then their hands burst forth from the ground<br>
Reeking of death<br>
Grasping, possessing<br>
They pull me down<br>
<br>
Now I find myself in a maze of prison bars, suspended on a bed of fire<br>
My flesh is burning away, Oh my God what have I done<br>
I’ve fallen into Hell, and now it’s too late</p>

If God was standing right in front of you,<br>
would you spit out hate like you always do.<br>
If God was standing right in front of you,<br>
Would you try to change your fate<br>
<br>
Did all of heaven weep,<br>
or was there only silence?<br>
<br>
Did all of heaven weep,<br>
or was there only silence?<br>
When the hour came and his choice was made,<br>
did he know that all his glory would fade?<br>
<br>
Show me heaven<br>
Show me hell<br>
<br>
Oh no!! my god has driven you away!</p>

        <h1 id="s8" class="lyrics-test">-Killing Time-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">please God, can you spare some change for a beggar?<br>
Night after night I scream but nobody's listening.<br>
(Nobody's Listening)<br>
We are headed down a path where the rocks peel the flesh from our feet.<br>
(Nobody's Listening)<br>
How much worse do things have to become before we rise up from the ruins.<br>
<br>
We are a generation that will stab you in the back just to get a piece of the pie<br>
<br>
Form a line to spare a dime as you watch countless children die<br>
We are "moving forward" but we've never been so far behind<br>
We're All just killing time by putting a knife through every clock that we find<br>
We're all just killing time<br>
<br>
Can you hear the cries of desperation?<br>
Can you hear the cries of desperation?<br>
Can you see the fire reduce to embers.<br>
<br>
We are a generation that will stab you in the back just to get a piece of the pie<br>
<br>
Where did it all go wrong?<br>
When did we lose our way?<br>
How can we fight for each other when we can't even stand our ground?<br>
Where did it all go wrong?<br>
When did we lose our way?<br>
Why do we run and hide as we watch our children die<br>
<br>
Can you hear the cries of desperation?<br>
Can you see the fire reduce to embers.<br>
Can you hear the cries of desperation?<br>
Can you see the fire reduce to embers.<br>
<br>
Can you hear the cries of desperation?<br>
See the face of starvation<br>
<br>
We Form a line to spare a dime as we watch countless children die<br>
We're All just killing time by putting a knife through every clock that we find<br>

KILLING TIME!!!</p>

        <p class="lyrics-test-test">
Can you ever forgive me?<br>
I will never forgive myself<br>
I've lost the one I held most dear<br>
All because of my own selfish desires<br>
<br>
God forgive me, for I will never forgive myself<br>
<br>
Heal me<br>
I scream at everything I am<br>
broken<br>
At everything I am<br>
Free me<br>
For I will never forgive myself<br>
Cleanse me<br>
For I am the disease<br>
<br>
I am anger<br>
I am hate<br>
I am hypocrisy (I'll crush your face)<br>
<br>
I am anger<br>
I am hate<br>
I am hypocrisy<br>
Don't look at me<br>
<br>
You were all that I held most dear<br>
Now all that I regret<br>
My hate has torn you apart<br>
God forgive me<br>
I cannot forgive myself<br>
<br>
Heal me<br>
I scream at everything I am<br>
broken<br>
At everything I am<br>
Free me<br>
For I will never forgive myself<br>
Cleanse me<br>
<br>
God forgive me, for I will never forgive myself<br>
I will never forgive myself<br>
<br>
You were all that I held most dear<br>
Now all that I regret<br>
My hate has torn you apart<br>
God forgive me<br>
I cannot forgive myself<br>
<br>
My hate has torn you apart<br>
<br>
God forgive me, I cannot forgive myself<br>
God forgive me, I cannot forgive myself<br>
God forgive me, I cannot forgive myself<br>
God forgive me, I cannot forgive myself</p>
