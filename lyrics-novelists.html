Already twenty years have passed and I still can't live at ease<br>
Oh, come on, fuck it<br>
They've made the game, but all the need is a spit at their faces<br>
When they play their shit<br>
<br>
We all live different hells<br>
Some may live with but some just can't<br>
So why should I live a different way?<br>
Yes, a different way

      <h1 id="f14" class="lyrics-test">-Heartfelt-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">[Bonus Track]<br>
<br>
Those heartfelt feelings that I got<br>
Are getting a hold of me<br>
I gotta let them be<br>
And this is why I need to tell you the things that I feel<br>
How much it means to me<br>
How much it counts to me<br>
<br>
You were into my heart before it locked itself<br>
You're all I can save from the shallowness<br>
You're the key of my soul<br>
But my soul is lost when love's a door that we fear to leave unlocked<br>
<br>
Even the worst we've lived could never change my mind<br>
You're bringing back the pulse in my veins<br>
You've seen the the back of my mind<br>
But now it's hard to mean something<br>
<br>
I found this fire burning into your breast<br>
This love has never been much brighter than what I could guess<br>
The things we've lacked could have changed us<br>
For a better version of ourselves<br>
<br>
No matter what they can say<br>
Or the price we might have to pay for this<br>
They can't change the way that I feel<br>
The way that I feel when you're away<br>
<br>
There is always a way to cross all the miles<br>
That will pave our fate<br>
We just can't change<br>
And the world can stop<br>
I won't give a fuck<br>
Cause I've got something that counts<br>
And I will never let it leave<br>
<br>
They spit the venom, I gotta take it out<br>
Love is a hushed bird you shouldn't cast out<br>
Well if it's meaning a break, they shouldn't have lied<br>
Shouldn't have spent a whole night riding a fat ass<br>
I can't feel a remorse, I can't have time to find why you're that addictive<br>
'Cause a sad heart cannot fake feelings<br>
It's not the first time that love is dead living<br>
<br>
It makes me sick, cause all of the mistakes we've done<br>
Were meant to make our path<br>
Snakes will keep spitting<br>
But we remain faithful to our beliefs<br>
<br>
I'm so tired of these shits, no matter what<br>
And how many times we've to rebuild on ruins<br>
A structure that can hold us closely<br>
<br>
No matter what they say<br>
Or the price we might have to pay for this<br>
They can't change the way I feel, they can't<br>
Nor your place in my heart when you're next to me<br>
<br>
Even the worst we've lived could never change my mind<br>
You're bringing back the pulse in my veins<br>
You've seen the back of my mind<br>
But now it's hard to mean something<br>
<br>
I found this fire burning into your breast<br>
This love has never been much brighter than what I could guess<br>
The things we've lacked could have changed us<br>
For a better version of ourselves<br>
<br>
The winter has passed<br>
I was hoping you'd hold on through those nights in the cold<br>
You don't know how much I'm hollow, how much I miss you<br>
The summer is coming<br>
I'm awaiting the day when I can finally take you home<br>
'Cause this time I'm gonna show you<br>
How much I love you

When I'm looking at these pictures<br>
Yellowed by the sun<br>
This weird emotion is sticking at my soul<br>
It numbs me to the bones<br>
<br>
These moments are battles I can't win<br>
<br>
Everything that I love is killing me<br>
And these lies won't save me any longer (can't save me anymore)<br>
I've destroyed one by one every beloved thing<br>
Right before my own eyes<br>
Slowly but surely<br>
<br>
One day I'll be part of the ghosts on your photographs<br>
And you'll forget about me when other ones come<br>
<br>
You will replace one by one every memories<br>
They will fall away and merge in the afterglow<br>
<br>
I cannot explain this feeling I'm having<br>
When I'm hearing these hearts singing<br>
Burdened by their dirge<br>
This weird emotion that's echoing with my soul is all I ever feared<br>
<br>
These moments are battles I can't win<br>
<br>
Everything that I love is killing me<br>
And these lies won't save me any longer (can't save me anymore)<br>
I've destroyed one by one every beloved thing<br>
Right before my own eyes<br>

This life can be such an adventure<br>
The world stands before my eyes wilder than it has ever been<br>

I forgot these old memories of youth that were caught right under the surface<br>
Forgot these souvenirs of you that were calling back the pain<br>
<br>
I never felt happy somehow<br>
But I'm trying, I'm trying the best I can<br>
I really wanna feel happy sometimes<br>
Really wanna know where the lights are<br>
But it only feels so wrong<br>
It's eating me alive<br>
<br>
I never know how to shorten the distance between my heart and my head<br>
'Cause through my eyes, the days are monochrome<br>
<br>
I wanna feel the light of a new day<br>
But I'm so scared of it all...<br>
I'm scared this utter joy ain't lasting forever<br>
It's eating me alive<br>

<br>
The three last years might have changed my life forever<br>
Now I just wanna break free from these towering walls<br>
To get this grey out of my mind<br>

'Cause when I'm here alone with the silence, I can't feel whole<br>
No, I can't feel whole<br>

But the world is changing<br>

Lost amongst the days I'm living<br>

In hope to save me from myself<br>

Not alone with my fucking pain, again<br>

Show me the fire, ignite me<br>
I'm feeling so cold<br>
I wanna know why I'm aching<br>
Look in my eyes, tell me what you see<br>
I'm feeling so numb<br>
I need a sign to keep on fighting<br>

I need a sign to keep on fighting<br>
Don't let me live my life in vain<br>

My life, like brought back to the ether<br>
My shadow is getting bigger<br>
And there's nowhere to run<br>
<br>
Get me rid of this chronic pain<br>
That drags me through the coldest hell<br>
There is not much left of who I've been<br>
I just cannot stop dreaming of the end<br>
I can't stop and it's killing me<br>
It's fucking killing me<br>

Caught in a web of lies<br>
I found out that the truth can hurt<br>
Just like a blade, a knife<br>
I'm about to let go<br>
I just can't do this on my own<br>

The pain is haunting my nights<br>
I'm fucking scared of what tomorrow could be<br>
And each time I try to face the light<br>
I just don't fucking feel it<br>

Oh please father show me a sign<br>
The devil starts to sing for me<br>
The light begins to fade away<br>
I fear for my fucking life<br>

A sense to their lives<br>

We are the desperate souls<br>
The children of a bottomless chasm<br>
We are the shadow of a dying world<br>

We're thousands, dead inside<br>
No constellation in our eyes<br>
Just dead stars<br>

You'll find no source of light<br>
Nor any answers in our hearts<br>
Just grey souls<br>

To numb the pain devour the soul like a black hole<br>
And let us fade along these monotonous days<br>
We're broken, seeking a way...<br>
Seeking a way out of this endless hell<br>
Confined inside the back of our fucking skulls<br>
<br>
We cower to hide from the light of the stars<br>
Back into the mire<br>
We're hopelessly drowning<br>
Our evils meddle with each fucking day<br>
This nascent fire will forever consume us<br>
