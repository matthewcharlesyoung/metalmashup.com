Seeking my Savior<br>

In a place where nobody goes<br>
A place where nobody knows<br>
Can you see the secrets?<br><br>

That steal the love from your sight<br>

Heaven waits for all of me<br>
For the day I can give everything<br>
Buried flesh restored spirit<br>
But until then this is my Deathwish<br>
Kill the man I am<br>
Kill the man I am.</p>

What are my words to you?<br>
And I've made my promises,<br>
and I've seen them fall to the ground.<br>
<br>
This kingdom I have built falls now to the ground.<br>
I let my tongue turn silver to make my heart into gold,<br>
but the only thing I convinced myself<br>
was that I could make diamonds from coal.<br>
Pages and pages of whom I'm meant to be;<br>
I can't seem to find the will to<br>
let these words set me free.<br><br>
Somewhere along the way I forgot<br>
that it wasn't all about me.<br>
I let the man that I was determine<br>
the man that I needed to be.<br>
My identity seems lost in the choices<br>
I have made and I can't believe I<br>
still go on making the same mistakes.<br>
Is the man that I am the man<br>
I was intended to be?<br><br>
I've dug my feet in the sand;<br>
mistook it for solid ground again.<br>
What are my words to you?<br>
And I've made my promises<br>
and I've seen them fall to the ground.<br>
This kingdom I have built falls now to the ground.<br>
I've lost the way to my word.<br><br>
A promise made is an action unheard.<br>
I lost the way to my word.<br>
I lost!<br>
I lost!<br>
A promise made is an action unheard.<br>
I lost!<br>
I lost!<br><br>
I used my voice to portray pictures of<br>
fiction to anyone that would look my<br>
way anything to get them to stay.<br>
If actions speak louder than words<br>
then surely I can't be heard.<br>

When was the last time<br>
I stopped to think about my life<br>
and the choices that I've made?<br>
What are these hands?<br>
Were they made to destroy?<br>
Have I fallen like the rest?<br>
In secret but nonetheless.<br><br>
With every step my feet they stray,<br>
yet I hold onto your words to find the way.<br>
Lead the way!<br>
Lead the way!<br>
So lead the way!<br>
<br>
Take this man who stands before you<br>
and tries to adore you<br>
but gets lost from time to time.<br>
I just feel like giving up<br>
and saying goodbye, but I pray for better days<br>
and I know they're not too far away.<br>
So take these words I say;<br><br>
bring life back into these ways.<br>
And though I hear your voice it's<br>
miles away (miles away.) What are these hands?<br>
What were they made for?<br>
Have I truly found solace in the arms of my Savior?<br>
Where is the great peace?<br>
Is it inside of me?<br><br>
I am weaker than I know.<br>
I am weaker than these virtues show.<br>
I am weaker than I know.<br>
I am weaker than these virtues show.<br>
I am weak, so take the rest of me!<br>
So take these words I say; bring life back into these ways.<br>
And though I hear your voice it's miles away (miles away.)<br>
Why can't I make it all<br><br>
go away?<br>
If dying is gain let Jesus take the rest of me?<br>
Why can't I make it all go away?<br>
If dying is gain let Jesus take the rest of me?<br>
Why can't I make it all go away?<br>
If dying is gain let Jesus take the rest of me?<br>
End.
