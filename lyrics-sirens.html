How can I trust in anyone who can barely<br>

You get what you deserve,<br>
there is no remorse for the scum of the earth.<br><br>
Deep down inside you're swimming in an ocean of guilt.<br>
You blame us all for the walls that you've built.<br>
One day you'll find that you've lost touch with everyone.<br>
There's not a person in site.<br>
So just open your eyes to a world you've never seen,<br><br>
and open your mind to a thought you'd never think.<br>
You get what you deserve there is no remorse<br>
for the scum of the earth. No remorse.<br>
The innocent is looking awfully guilty.<br><br>
I'm not convinced, and I will not be deceived.<br>
I honestly wish you nothing but the best.<br>
I know you'll always hate me.<br>
So just open your eyes to a world you've never seen,<br><br>
and open your mind to a thought you'd never think.<br>
You have no one to blame but yourself.<br>
So just open your eyes to a world you've never seen,<br>

This is my time, it's now or it's never for me.<br>
How can I dream if I don't ever sleep? Tonight,<br>
I just stare into the dark and hope there's a light.<br>
I hope there's a light on the other side.<br>

keep moving forward, keep moving forward.<br><br>
Gone away, are all of the things that we used to say,<br>

This is the last time you'll hear me say,<br>

Yesterday, is just a memory that fades away.<br><br>

Finally, our time has come,<br>

We have conquered the impossible.<br><br>
Nothings impossible.<br>
All the dreams I've chased,<br>
all the choices the I have made are falling into place.<br>
Leave it all behind,<br>
leave it all in the past.<br>
I'm moving forward now,<br>

If this ship goes down then I'll going sinking with it<br>
I will fight for all of the things that I believe in<br>
If this ship goes down then I'll going sinking with it (I'll go sinking with it)<br>
I will fight for all of the things that I believe in<br>
<br>
The world will not wait for you<br>
This is your only chance<br>
To leave behind your legacy<br>
Don't let it slip right through your hands<br>
<br>
The world will not wait for you<br>
The world it will not wait<br>
The world will not wait for you<br>
The world it will not wait<br>
Now it's time to prove yourself<br>
<br>
I won't die, I won't die here tonight (Here tonight)<br>
I will fight, only the strong survive<br>
<br>
If this ship goes down then I'll go sinking with it<br>
I will fight for all of the things that I believe in<br>
If this ship goes down then I'll go sinking with it (I'll go sinking with it)<br>
I will fight for all of the things that I believe in</p>

I always knew that this could never last<br>
You dug this grave for yourself, so now you're gonna lie in it<br>

The thought of you makes me sick to my stomach<br>
To trust you was a lesson learned<br>
If I saw your body catch fire<br>
I swear I'd just watch it burn baby, burn<br>
I wanna watch you burn baby, burn<br>
<br>
Look at you now, good as dead<br>
A feast for the vultures that fly overhead<br>
Who are you now? You're a mess<br>
You pushed them away, now you having nothing left<br>
<br>
You dug this grave, now you will lay<br>
Under every choice and decision you made<br>
Nothing you say will ever change<br>
The way I feel about you<br>
That's the price that you pay<br>

          <p class="lyrics-test-test">Welcome to my personal hell, won't you be my guest?<br>
I'm just a tormented soul, demented, and possessed<br>
No matter how high I climb, I keep falling back<br>
Will I ever escape this endless punishment?<br>
<br>
There is a monster inside of me, it will eat you alive<br>
Stay away or you'll be next. Run, run for your life!<br>
<br>
Save me, save me from myself<br>
I keep hiding secrets that I wish I could tell<br>
But I'll never tell. I'll never tell<br>
<br>
I said I didn't need it, but I could really use the help<br>
The way that I've been feeling is a way I've never felt<br>
The evil's overtaking, my eyes are seeing red<br>
Soon I will be covered in the blood that has been shed<br>
<br>
There is a monster inside of me, it will eat you alive<br>
There is a monster inside of me, it will eat you alive<br>
Stay away or you'll be next. Run, run for your life!<br>
<br>
Save me, save me from myself<br>
I keep hiding secrets that I wish I could tell<br>
But I'll never tell. I'll never tell<br>
<br>
Into the fire, that's where I fell<br>
Welcome to my own personal hell<br>
<br>
I greeted Death like an old friend<br>
As he reached out his hand I felt my body descend<br>
Into the fire, that's where I fell<br>
Welcome to my own personal hell</p>

Pull the plug and watch us flatline<br>

Falling behind me<br>
We were something<br>
Now we're nothing<br>
Please don't remind me<br>
Don't say you ever cared<br>
'Cause you were never there for me<br>

Don't say you ever cared<br>
'Cause you were never there<br>
Never there for me<br>
This isn't what I want<br>
You are not who I thought<br>
Who I thought you'd be<br>
<br>
I fell pathetic, I hung onto every word<br>
Your speech perfected as if you had it all rehearsed<br>
Put the nail in the coffin and cover me with dirt<br>
And there's no getting better, it will only get worse<br>
<br>
Falling behind me<br>
We were something<br>
Now we're nothing<br>
Please don't remind me<br>
Don't say you ever cared<br>
'Cause you were never there for me<br>

I don't know why I hurt<br>
Or ever questioned myself worth over someone like you<br>
But if you want to see the scars<br>
I will carve out my own heart just to show you the proof<br>
I'm dead inside because of you<br>

Hopeless one, don't hang your head<br>
Who you become is up to you in the end<br>
It's a long way down<br>
Don't let yourself hit rock bottom<br>

Stop living to die, start dying to live<br>
This is where the torment ends<br>
Stop living to die, start dying to live<br>
This is where your life begins<br>

You value everyone else's opinions<br>
But never seem to value your own<br>
Why be a pawn when you can be a king?<br>
And lead yourself straight to victory<br>

Hopeless one, don't hang your head<br>

We hold a compass, but have no place to call home<br>
A sense of wonder and a desire to grow<br>
As we venture into the unknown<br>

Find our place here, what's our purpose?<br>
There has to be more than what's on the surface<br>
Rising Moon, setting Sun<br>
Cast your shadow, watch over us<br>

As we sleep and drift away<br>
Into a dream, upon these waves<br>
Rising Moon, Setting Sun<br>
Cast your shadow, watch over us<br>

Soaring above, never sinking below<br>
We will persevere, we will stay afloat<br>
Through every storm and test of our will<br>
Our courage can not ever be killed<br>

So what are you waiting for?<br>
I'm standing right in front of you<br><br>

Always wishing that I had another chance<br>
Always hoping to hear a heartbeat in my chest<br>
I used to love my life when I had it<br>
Now I spend all my time in this casket<br>

Listen to the melody of the voices in your head<br>
Sing along so willingly to the chorus of the dead<br>

What the fuck is wrong with me?<br>
Where did I go wrong?<br>
I took for granted everyday of my life, forever lost<br>
Rolled the dice, I was gambling<br>
I took the risk, and I went all in<br>
A mistake I will not forget<br>
Here I lay rotting in regret<br>

Listen to the melody of the voices in your head<br>
Sing along so willingly to the chorus of the dead<br>

I used to love my life when I had it<br>
Now I spend all my time in this casket<br>

And everyday it's the same old thing<br>
I'm starting to think it's not worth my time<br>

Overlooked, pushed aside, counted out<br>
Took their negativity and turned it around<br>
