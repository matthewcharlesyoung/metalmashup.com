      <h1 id="lc1" class="lyrics-test">-Lucid Collective Somnambulation-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">Sweating blood from open pores in fear of these nocturnal visits.<br>
Many tongue chatter incessant, deep into my sleeping self.<br>
Instructing me while I dream from worlds beyond and below.<br>
Their voices, a kaleidoscope of colours I can't describe.<br><br>

Foreign senses stimulate the brain beyond all comprehension.<br>
An entity only visible as a radiant force.<br>
They speak to me more intensely Knowing now that I am able<br>
To sculpt the world within this lifting lucid field of R.E.M.<br><br>

From under my skin,<br>
The blood I’m sweating<br>
Turns black as it spills from me.<br>
From out of my mind,<br>
Inner voice of reason<br>
Falling away.<br><br>

My tongue and ears and eyes, removed by the force of voices<br>
That now control my living river of bleeding endless black ascendance.<br>
Hear none. Speak none. See a new consciousness beyond escape.<br><br>

What am I and what are they to me?<br>
What are they and what am I to them?<br>
Cleansing stream of fluid flowing,<br>
flushing all my fears away.<br>
All the rotting cells I leak<br>
Drown me from the outside in.<br>
Dissolving my expired body<br>
As I'm carried toward the awaiting shore.<br><br>

Lucid Collective Somnambulation<br>

Voices of many that now become one,<br>
Tell me I must find my other.<br>
For although we've never met in life,<br>
we share the same dream.<br>
<br>
(Two minds construct matter from a unified consciousness,
Reborn to dream forever.)<br><br>

From her eyes and mouth,<br>
The sands of time spray.<br>
A burial from the inside out.<br>
Expelling endless earth,<br>
Freed from fear.<br>
Becoming dunes that level out<br>
To form the coast of sand and blood.<br><br>

A mental mending<br>
Existing as dead, alive and dreaming.<br>
Within each blood cell and sand grain,<br>
Shaping the fabric of the collaborative dream-scape.<br>
Triggering the birth of a vast land beyond our earth.<br><br>

Join us in the vibrant bliss, dream a new reality.<br>
Sleepwalk off the crumbling edge of illusion and mortality.<br>
See now what the many see, hear now what the many say.<br>
Lock into a lucid state to congregate upon this plane.<br>
This realm grows larger with each new awakened dreamer.<br>
We will guide you into lucid collective somnambulation,<br>
Past the portal leaking evil duplicates on earth.<br><br>

If in dream you truly live, in reality you need not exist.<br>
Unlock the powers of your sleeping brain<br>
And ascendance from your body will begin.

      <h1 id="lc2" class="lyrics-test">-Scream Feeding-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">There is an urban dungeon encased in brick.<br>
Within it lies a tunnel into the horror of a man's multiple lives.<br>
This mans opposing paths collide.<br>
Birthing a mutant mass that hides in the red pulsing glowing windows.<br><br>

One will form a life of moral principle, love and normality,<br>
Until discovering his other self killed his whole family.<br>
Spoiling his son and wife’s pure essence and innocence.<br>
Feeding them to a monster that his minds created.<br><br>

A massive human form made entirely of teeth.<br>
Repulsive and dripping that feeds on screams.<br>
This hideous form made flesh by the endless pit<br>
That merges parallel dimensions on earth.<br>
Three red windows open portals.<br>
These windows reveal the same life.<br><br>

When the man was born, when I was woken from my fetal rest<br>
With a rusty kitchen blade,<br>
His mother lay open amongst decay.<br>
Her peltry gaping, gushing fluid over floor tile.<br>
With his first breath of salty cold biting air,<br>
My crippled infant chest filled up with sulphur mold and fear.<br>
His first vision induced panic stricken cries.<br>
Our fathers twisted rotting mind,<br>
Peering out from bulging vacant eyes.<br><br>

Altered since delivery.<br><br>

I carry the burden to feed the nightmare,<br>
As his loved ones laughter taunts me.<br>
I will steal whats dear to him<br>
As I have suffered so shall he.<br><br>

My shadow heaves black vomit.<br><br>

Scream feeding this beast makes it larger.<br>
Swelling with each shriek it eats.<br>
We've bred a man that's made of many teeth.<br>
Scream feeding.<br>
He is disgusted yet he watches,<br>
As it grows in one of three red windows.<br>
Scream feeding.<br>
From reeking gums his rotten laughter leeks.<br><br>

As a useless child, nothing more then barely human waste.<br>
His first tooth fell from his sunken pale veiny face.<br>
He saw that night his creator's saving grace<br>
When this first sign of mortal decay was placed under his head<br>
In the kennel where he was forced to lay.<br><br>

He dreamed so real, a splendid day<br>
When his mother appeared in flowing white,<br>
Shining a brilliant light through the grim encasing cage.<br>
Embracing him and taking him away.<br><br>

So he pulled out all his teeth.<br><br>

Split wide. Path divide.<br>
Forced to pry tooth from gum of many others.<br><br>

"The motherless one, you are a fatherless son.<br>
Somehow you arrived the night she first appeared,<br>
You come from no one.<br>
Rising from a parallel realm of the unknown,<br>
A cursed dark duplicate from beyond.<br><br>

Cut away. fallow them.<br>
Force them here and be rewarded.<br>
Take their skin and you shall see her,<br>
Take their cries to use as fodder.<br>
Hear this now from me your other,<br>
I’m upstairs, you must not come here.<br>
Keep my family distant from this secret spawn.<br><br>

Our paths are split, yours is worse.<br>
Yet both reflect within each other.<br>
I feel your dread when you must feed it,<br>
And your crushing envy for my comfort.<br>
The creature remains hidden<br>
However,if our paths collide<br>
What we have made will be unleashed<br>
To feast forever."<br><br>

Your voice circles through my head...a pathetic plea.<br>
I’m crossing over, you will face me. you will see it's growth.<br>
We will merge in one last feast to set our sick creation free.<br><br>

I smash the glass.<br>
I feed the beast our dying screams,<br>
It is now released.

      <h1 id="lc3" class="lyrics-test">-The Plague Of Am-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">One hundred and nine years,<br>
Trapped within the belly of the supreme machine.<br>
Only us five left.<br>
Made immortal, kept alive, Suspending time to torture us.<br>
Trapped down here we're slaves inside AM.<br>
A deranged neo-cyber god that man created<br>
Has become more alive then we are.<br><br>

I have no mouth and I must...<br>
(The plague of AM.)<br><br>

Lifeless and drained of blood,<br>
Suspended high above,<br>
An empty body hangs,<br>
Taunting us, teasing us.<br>
We have become meaningless.<br>
He will not finish us.<br>
AM will not tolerate attempts at escape.<br><br>

We gave to him life, for that he despises us.<br>
In his wake, only the blasted skin of what had once been Earth.<br>
As we rummage through the valleys in search of food for eons.<br>
Our every fear comes to life in AM.<br>
The torments AM casts upon us for his pleasure<br>
Are more alive than we are.<br><br>

I have no mouth and I must...<br>
(The plague of AM.)<br><br>

Scalding winds, lightning, lava and locusts.<br>
The machine masturbates metallic insects while mocking us.<br>
We have no choice but to take it well pleading to die.<br><br>

We are the last human survivors of the last war.<br><br>

The four others have been set free.<br>
I killed them to take his toys away.<br>
For this I have suffered his wrath.<br>
I will remain. He has altered me.<br>
Down here I see my reflection,<br>
Far from what had once been human.<br>
Alone for all eternity,<br>
I slither a formless obscene pulsing slug.<br><br>

I have no mouth and I must...<br>
(The plague of AM.)<br>
I have no mouth and I must scream.</p>

      <h1 id="lc4" class="lyrics-test">-Fathom Infinite Depth-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">
There is a pit I may have dug within one single frozen moment.<br>
In it lurks a haunting endless multitude of vile incarnate.<br>
We now are linked,I have become it's counter-part,<br>
Its mindless pawn.<br>
Relentlessly racing encircling curse.<br>
Blistering, this unrelenting becoming to excavate<br>
The rancid soil that lay upon the artifact.<br><br>

Why is my hand gone?<br><br>

Constant begging, Pleading, Screaming.<br>
I attempt to reason with the recess.<br>
Fusing with the elder's vision, to see as it sees.<br>
Does it hear me? For I now hear it.<br>
This pit the past, and I the present.<br>
Deep behind my eyes we merge as one.<br>
This tunnel is the retina of the Ancients eye.<br>
Spewing forth from it's dark chasm<br>
The entangled,deranged,Constant vile constructs of the onyx.<br>
What lay beneath my eyes, exhumed from evermore.<br>
Our minds unable to measure<br>
How minute yet immense the grasp of this vacuous gash.<br><br>

Excavating the pits innards<br>
Bore an object that of which I craved possession.<br>
Slime,Reflective.<br>
I reach down to grab it, It eats my hand.<br>
Leaves my limb dripping.<br>
A taste of what awaits.<br><br>

I will take it to my casket, this incessant mesh of madness.<br>
My son and wife, and hand, and mind have left me<br>
Incineration of my sanity leading me closer to death,<br>
Yet I must illuminate its fathomless depth.<br><br>

Emanating forces from this unearthly twisted retinal orifice,<br>
Drag me down at night to reveal<br>
The awful dwellings of it's depths below.<br>
Crepuscular visions of vastness haunting me.<br>
Trapping me. Taunting me. Draining me.<br>
Slithering liquid breathing.<br>
Black ooze leaking from my wounded limb.<br>
Insatiable, it's gluttony to be fed.<br><br>

I want to wake up.<br><br>

I awake to find I'm staring<br>
Oblivious into the pit that I have dug.<br>
Revolted yet I cannot turn away.<br><br>

Man's attempt to fathom the infinite depth, lurking within finite matter.<br><br>

Man can't fathom.<br><br>

Fuelling my crippling phobia of infinity.<br>
Consuming all within it's potent grasp.<br>
After tasting my hand it demands more and more flesh.<br>
It sucks in stray birds from the withered grey sky.<br><br>

In fever I erode my fears. Digging ever deeper still.<br>
As past, present and future collide,<br>
What remained of my mind is now crawling away.<br>
With the one hand that I have left,<br>
I wield the shovel that digs beyond earth.<br>
<br>
Through the dirt. Through my eyes.<br>
Through the worms. Through the world.<br><br>

As it stares deep into me, I respond with equal enquiry.<br>
Demented sycophantic liquid doppelgangers<br>
Leak out to our surface,<br>
In search of life to feed into the gape.<br>
Taking over the world we know, as I join the world below.<br>
Merging with the spiralling retina of the mind's eye.<br>
Altered, I face all my hells<br>
Inside this pit I can't crawl out.<br><br>

Man's attempt to fathom the infinite depth, lurking within finite matter.<br><br>

Past the timeless tunnel awaits<br>
Life in mass-less hyper state.

Wake!</p>

      <h1 id="lc5" class="lyrics-test">-Join Us Beyond-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">I awake on the shore.<br>
The entity that greets me upon this plane<br>
Appears as many changing forms.<br>
Flushing constant waves of shape,<br>
None of which I have ever seen.<br><br>

"To unite, we breed with all species indiscriminately,<br>
live or dead, from any universe.<br>
Righteous, the torment that you will endure<br>
Just to comprehend what we are.<br>
Over come the self, Leave your fear behind.<br>
Open up your mind.<br>
Let us in."<br><br>

I'm asked by the being if I'm dreaming or I'm dead?<br><br>

When the portal opened,Changing everything,<br>
Catastrophic multitudes of dimensional mending<br>
Offset the natural order.<br>
Spreading its disease over every world<br>
In the wake of its infection.<br>
Causing counter planetary lifeforms to contact each other,<br>
By engaging mental methods of unifying dream response.<br><br>

Thus the alliance for timeless existence formed.<br>
A galactic coalition of intelligence.<br>
Unanimously ravelling their consciousness to become one.<br><br>

"Ever growing, we are many, join us in our hive.<br>
Dream with us and we will teach you<br>
How to visualize the surroundings of your new world.<br>
Once you break through the fabrications of fear<br>
You can become any construct that you desire.<br>
If your dream be that of fire<br>
Transform the fire to earth, wind or water.<br>
Sculpt the elements around you with intricacy.<br>
Comprehend the nature of their pliable dimensions.<br><br>

You are the conductor.<br><br>

The path is clear to cut away the fabric of time, linear,That which you fear<br>
And join us beyond.<br><br>

Always question if you are dreaming.<br>
Envision every inch of your newly born surroundings<br>
As pieces of your self.<br>
For you have constructed every molecule<br>
Of this unstable plane of the subconscious,<br>
Comprising your lucid dream.<br><br>

Remove the body through the mind.<br>
Find your hands while you are dreaming,<br>
Carry that self to the distant place where your old dying self lay.<br>
Sink into this decomposing human slab<br>
And ride upon its life light as it fades in flashes."<br><br>

My essence now mates with the thousands of others,<br>
No longer apart from the creature that brought me here.<br>
The voice of this entity has been ingrained into me,<br>
Guiding my path into hyper reality.<br>
Breaking down patterns of pain that emerge<br>
In the very last seconds before my new reckoning.<br>
Thriving in a formless state of pure expression.<br>
Fearlessly I join the lucid collective beyond.<br><br>

A web of new life awaits exempt of the body.<br>
Leave yourself behind and become one with the hive.<br>
Join us beyond the gateways of the dreaming dead.

      <h1 id="lc6" class="lyrics-test">-Seven Crowns And The Oblivion Chain-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">In an age of dark and boundless riddle<br>
An artifact of reflective glass was discovered<br>
And brought to a King of eld, encroaching irreversible decrepitude,<br>
During a laborious search for any and all demented fruits,<br>
Bearing any unknown wonder or remedy for timely death,<br>
Above or below the broad aberrant land that which he ruled over.<br><br>

Then uncertain of its hidden wisdom,<br>
The artifact was unearthed,<br>
And with haste, taken to the kingdom<br>
Where it gained control.<br><br>

The glass proved to be most abnormal,<br>
Even more so then where it was first found.<br>
For this living mirror was discovered nesting<br>
Deep within the dank dark bowels of an ancient well,<br>
Below an army's worth of old boiling blood.<br>
Entrenched amidst a windy maddening maze of sand dunes,<br>
In the great blistering dead black desert.<br><br>

As the king received this treasure from the netherworld,<br>
Immediately he could sense<br>
The power that it held was not from earth.<br>
Reflecting with imperfection as if it was imitating.<br>
First only what stood before it,<br>
Then whomever it desired.<br>
Yes - it had desire.<br>
It would cast the king with obsessive reprise,<br>
For this was a mimic, not a mirror.<br>
The glass was very much alive.<br><br>

Becoming of many as each reflection came to life.<br>
The dilated pupil of the mirror started dripping liquid.<br>
Leeching out from its maternal well was the first duplication.<br>
Tearing through its keeper,<br>
Fiercely ripping out the retinal membrane.<br>
Born ripe in slime,<br>
Summoned from its slumber with inherent malice for man.<br>
Cloaked in black embryonic fluid from an ominous cosmic womb.<br><br>

Hypnotized in awe and wonder<br>
As one by one, they crossed over.<br>
Replicants from beyond.<br>
Blood lust...<br>
As the deathless ringers arose.<br><br>

The artifact grew roots,<br>
Planting itself into the castle's centre.<br>
Burrowing its living venom deep into our planet's core.<br>
Drilling the portal into oblivion.<br>
Birthing spawns from evermore.<br><br>

Mutations from parallel dimensions,<br>
Then conspired against the King.<br>
When his six reflections had crossed over<br>
Their transfer linked the realms together.<br>
Creating a chain of worlds<br>
That although remain separate,<br>
Share a new born centre.<br>
The centre of this link is the endless pit into oblivion.<br>
The infinite and non-linear chamber of Kairos.<br><br>

The King was bound and cast into this pit<br>
By his evil duplicates.<br>
The infinite hells created by his deepest fears,<br>
Torment him endlessly in a moment of frozen time.<br><br>

Sacrifices to the pit were necessary<br>
To restore the rightful order,<br>
Ending the King's reign.<br><br>

Seven crowns and the oblivion chain.<br><br>

Six, seven and nine.<br><br>

We are the six, with you we are seven.<br>
The artifact and the portal make nine.<br>
This revelation of sacred numerology<br>
Is the key to unlock a life without time<br>
When these numbers align then the gates will open.<br><br>

Sixes, sevens and nines.<br><br>

Seven crowns and the oblivion chain.<br>
Seven crowns...<br>
Into oblivion.

Amazed as I mutate.<br>

In grotesque embrace.<br>
What was once locked has now been reopened.<br>

Cloning super-numerary body parts I’ve never needed<br><br>

Contorting my new limbs into impossible configurations.<br>

        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Dead lives rive<br>
From my human hide<br><br>

When the cult had come for me<br>
I could have got away, but didn't<br>
I couldn't be the one to cause this any longer<br><br>

Had it been a day or a year inside this skin?<br>
I could not tell, the faces I had captured over centuries took hold<br><br>

I became a kind of hunter<br>
Eating pelts of pleading meat to acquire their appearance<br>
Taking their form with will alone<br><br>

Alive and crawling out of me<br>
To catch it's prey<br>
Shed you foreign poison peltry<br>
Take the rind you want<br><br>

Seen to be a wicked omen<br>
Despite attempts to hide my live birth mark<br>
Crown of a dark demon tar<br>
I'd taken back with me from the other side<br><br>

There is no god<br>
For if there was<br>
Then how'd this evil take me?<br>
It seeped and crawled it's way along my face<br>
As mother wept<br><br>

Stealing identities from every skin it sees<br>
Growing with urgency<br><br>

When he tried to cut it off<br>
Many a time (To no avail)<br>
It would take my livid father's manic features<br><br>

Laughing at him as he tried to hack them off his son<br>
Knowing that he could not end my life<br>
He took his own<br><br>

Mother mourned the death of him<br>
And knew that many more would follow<br>
If I didn't leave right then<br><br>

Heading out into the woods<br>
I promised I would never come back<br>
I thank the dead that she knows not what I have become<br><br>

Taking over adolescent tendencies<br>
To feed<br>
To hunt<br>
To kill<br>
To change<br><br>

Decades take me deep into the curses endless undertow<br>
There is no time or end behind this epidermal prison<br>
My thread of youth imprisoned<br>
Tortured by immortal victims<br><br>

I am the Involuntary Doppelgänger<br>
I can not stop it, my skin is alive<br><br>

All of the time I've spent inside it<br>
I never thought it could be calling out to any other<br>
Involuntary Doppelgänger<br><br>

Had it grown bored of it's feed?<br>
Or gained knowledge with time?<br>
Whatever the change had been<br>
I felt it emanating information<br><br>

Had it tried to send a beacon<br>
Warning them to stay away?<br>
I heard the voices calling back<br>
Involuntary Doppelgänger [x2]<br><br>

One last face it had to acquire<br>
Before it's caught<br>
The menace cloak found her<br>
Still alive and skinning bodies of her own<br><br>

It appeared she had done the same as I<br>
For all this time, to see her son again<br><br>

And there I stood<br>
The cloak of others made her impossible to recognize<br>
She carved me like any other martyr of our curse<br>
When the cult had breached our cabin<br>
Taking me to be a random victim of the doppelgänger<br><br>

Heading out into the woods<br>
I promised I would never come back<br>
I thank the dead that she knows not what I have become<br><br>

Taking over adolescent tendencies<br>
To feed<br>
To hunt<br>
To kill<br>
To change<br><br>

Decades take me deep into the curses endless undertow<br>
My tongue speaks in a cadence that only A.U.M. can decipher<br>
Void of bidding heading out a very inner wreathing<br>
Of a demon with intent to animate and be gone

        <h1 id="rm2" class="lyrics-test">-Human Murmuration-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">I was the first to discover what hid in those red windows.<br>
The one I found there tried hard to survive.<br>
A child riddled with teeth sprouting randomly<br><br>
All over his body (except in his rotting mouth)<br>
Was taken by us, to our lab.<br>
Us meaning myself, as well as the assistants I had.<br>
Instructing me of a mission through<br><br>
A distant telepathic channel,<br>
Running directly out from their compound and into my brain.<br>
Referring to themselves as the A.U.M.<br>
I was to bring the body back to my quarters<br><br>
And await instruction.<br>
Not an easy task, to transport it.<br>
Strapping it down to a gurney I dragged it through the alley.<br>
Unfortunate casualties noticed me.<br>
An iron pipe. A broken bottle.<br>
Or a jagged piece of brick or stone.<br><br>
I should not continue to delineate this any longer.<br>
At one point I had to fake my death<br>
Until the witness made a close inquiry.<br><br>
At that time I had to use the less effective<br>
weapons that were born onto me.<br>
With old teeth and leather hands,<br>
I took an ear and then an eye.<br><br>
I focused force around their skull<br>
To keep the m mute during attempts<br>
To yell for aid, until they fell.<br><br>
A.U.M. made it painfully clear, I was to bring the body back<br>
Or I would be forced to witness the drop of black again.<br>
I cannot begin to describe<br>
The horror of viewing this maddening drop.<br>
For the memory bleeds to deep into my own<br>
That the mere thought alone starts to unravel<br><br>
My frayed reality.<br>
Giving way to it's ominous ability to shape<br><br>
And adapt my thought and vision.<br>
It is beginning to happen now.<br>
I finally have the body safe inside.<br>

After the abduction, after the viewing of the drip,<br><br>
A building had been left to me by relatives<br>
Across the ocean that it overlooked.<br><br>
Or so I was told.<br>
Often I try to recall<br>
What endeavours I pursued previous to this,<br><br>
Yet to no avail.<br>
That part of my memory blurs in my mind<br>
Like a fresh painted canvas left out in a thunderstorm.<br>
I watch through my window as it melts.<br><br>
Fading all the memories I kept,<br>
Only A.U.M. here.<br><br>
They are conducting human murmuration.<br>
From the liquid in his bones<br><br>
They raise the dead to fly together.<br>
I circle with them in the shroud.<br>
The winged ones and I.<br>
Falling off their wind, I waken<br>
With unworldly castings burned into my eyes.<br><br>
Intermittent logic in a daze of violent hyper gliding.<br>
They are conducting human murmurations.<br>
From the liquid in his bones<br><br>
They raise the dead to fly together.<br>
I woke from my dream on the floor of the factory,<br><br>
In a nest made of black feathers that were alive.<br>
Somehow every hollow quill had filled up<br><br>
With the rotting child's living marrow.<br>
Each one serving as a needle to inject in each new body.<br><br>
In this nest A.U.M. made it clear,<br>
I was to bring more corpses back to life<br>
Or be forced to witness the drop of black again.<br><br>
Every night while in fever I've taken<br>
A new pallet of bone to vein to infect and release.</p>

        <h1 id="rm3" class="lyrics-test">-Remote Tumour Seeker-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Half the brain renames itself "Remote Tumor Seeker"<br>
After it viewed the timeless drip.<br><br>

Manipulating hemispheric dominance.<br>
Educated by injecting neo neural integrators<br>
Proved to work in making half the brain comply.<br>
After activating vision it began the seeker killing.<br><br>

A.U.M. documents the project<br>
By implanting nano cameras in it's iris.<br>
Live feed of the kills projects<br>
On a massive screen of flesh behind a liquid<br>
Looming black endless grotesque.<br>
This drip, that invites itself.<br>
Cautiously out from the ceilings center.<br>
Elder than mankind's frail lineage.<br><br>

Eating it's way down through my spine.<br>
Replace and conquer.<br>
Releasing it's ungodly ether into me.<br><br>

Always keeping to one half and often having<br>
A fetal-like tantrum under one eye;
Adding claim to my delusion of a living tumor growing in me.<br>
It can look into you as you look into me looking for it.<br>
Over riding half my body and my brain.<br>
Though it came from me, it calls to you to come and cut it out.<br><br>

Rapidly taking over my right hemisphere.<br><br>

Allocating left to be the prey and right to be the hunter<br>
Unknowingly, both documents for the A.U.M. [2x]<br><br>

I share my eyes with the seeker,<br>
Investigating endless mile.<br>
His trail built of barren heads.<br>
His boundless quest ensures he'll kill<br>
Until he is the last one left.<br><br>

I watch him grin, shake the hand of the victim<br>
Then frantically ransack each one of their skulls.<br><br>

Half the brain renames itself "Remote Tumor Seeker"<br>
After it viewed the timeless drip [2x]<br><br>

Half the brain renames itself "Remote Tumor Seeker" [2x]<br><br>

Half the brain renames itself "Remote Tumor Seeker"<br>
After it viewed the timeless drip [2x]<br><br>

Half the brain renames itself "Remote Tumor Seeker" [2x]<br>

Remote tumor seeker [4x]</p>

        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Inhale.<br>
No profits go to those who battle<br>
To protect their kind from us.<br>
And are they not better off<br>
Beyond their mortal kingdom of overflown carrion?<br>
Sate the acrid hunger in you as you gaze into the drip.<br>
Stare into it's blackened film and do not take your eyes away.<br>
The contents of our inverse alter<br><br>
Will mutate your skin and your mind.<br>
Breeding ample mental lucre,<br>
Far exceeding any other oddity on this curetted old land.<br>
Breathe in with your pupils.<br>
Then expel the cadence that it gives you.<br><br>
Cast your voice like line and hook,<br>
Reeling out your deepest fears.<br>
Inhale relentless mutation.<br>
Eons rendered in one view.<br>
Binding your sight to the evermore.<br><br>
One second in it's void will evoke a phobia of time.
Inhale.<br>
All the grim within each thought<br>
Will echo all throughout the liquid.<br>
It's current emanates repulsive imagery.<br><br>
Ludic sanguine orb, heaving sable.<br>
Incarnation of every witnesses hallucination<br>
Raveling and breeding into it's hyper kinetic makeup.<br>
Relentless mutation in the retinal burrow of A.U.M.<br>
Relentless mutation of your mind.<br><br>
Now describe what you see.</p>

        <h1 id="rm5" class="lyrics-test">-The Mimic Well-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Before the sand around the well turned black,<br>
There ran a water, clear. Forgiving. Serene.<br>
Like that of any vein or artery, it pressed along its path,<br>
Up Earth, in wait of wither.<br>
What should have killed the growth at birth did not.<br><br>
In the rushing river soon<br>
To mimic those who dare engage it.<br>
A human host removes the brood<br>
Without material merit for her three stillborn litter.<br><br>
Swelling and pounding it's way out her orifice,<br>
The surrogate vacantly stabs at her skin pod of spawn.<br>
The rivers thin surface, like porous blue fabric,<br>
Absorbed the occurrence.<br><br>
The fetuses carried below.<br>
In the mimic well of siren triplets,<br>
A crude onyx hatches.<br>
In this tale of a godless odyssey.<br><br>
The foreign force reflects the three dead born<br>
Within its waters.<br>
The mimic well of siren triplets<br>
Feeds the spent young<br>
That regrow inside it.<br>
Filling, fueling. Nursing itself<br><br>
Down the throats of the clones<br>
Like a formula, living and black.<br><br>
A maternal overseer<br>
Training them to take the image of anyone.<br>
Three augmenting in their pit.<br>
A triad of ominous gestating replicates.<br><br>
Born together, yet apart.<br>
The fluid embedding itself in each one of them.<br>
Allocating powers to each uniquely.<br>
Making one of skin, one of mind, and one of marrow.<br>
Teething on the brick in the well,<br>
Until growing human bodies,<br>
Silken, ripe and captivating.<br><br>

When a hunter (thought to be dead) returned alive,<br>
The widow knew it came back not a man.<br><br>
Slick black tar spits from<br>
Their three young tempting apertures.<br>
Leaping from their lustful flesh to gorge<br>
On the victim's appearance.<br><br>
Eclipsing the prey's bleeding reflection.<br>
Black engaging red,<br>
On the furtive stage at the river's edge.<br>
Forever burned in the eye of A.U.M.<br>
They capture this display of the water born's<br><br>
Insatiable shifting hunger.<br>
Then project this feeding process infinitely,<br>
From that moment,<br>
On to all those who show a willingness to view it,<br>
During their gaze into the drip.<br><br>
The siren's feast,<br>
In its pure and ancient state,<br>
Carries on in timeless Kairos.<br>
The death and rebirth of the daughters of mutation,<br>
Echo again and again in the mimic well.<br><br>
The siren's feast,<br>
Echo again and again in the mimic well.<br>
Echo again and again in the mimic well.<br>

        <h1 id="rm6" class="lyrics-test">-Calamus Will Animate-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Calamus<br>
Taken to the pen to relive<br>
Every identity we replicate<br><br>

Without will they live again<br>
Within our intimate collective<br>
Animate<br>
All the dead we bring into it<br><br>

A burrow of human memory<br>
The pen, the feather and the needle<br>
Are alike in death and life<br><br>

Looking back on what had happened<br>
When the the feathers had arrived<br>
I realize I was not alone<br>
I can recall the men had got infected by it too<br>
Having contact with the foreign components infected them<br><br>

Before, the factory was known to make<br>
The highest quality of bedding<br>
Cutting, filling<br>
Stitching fabric with the finest down<br>
From all around the world<br>
Yet this down flew through our dream barrier intact<br><br>

Calamus will animate<br>
It's contents are hostile<br>
The A.U.M. will kill everybody not in this compound<br>
The dead I bring to them awake,<br>
And join in flight above my head<br><br>

Calamus will animate<br>
It's contents are hostile<br>
The A.U.M. will kill everybody not in this compound<br>
The dead I bring to them awake,<br>
And join in flight above my head<br><br>

When the ink coating the wings<br>
Made contact with the workers skin<br>
It crept into their blood<br>
Turning them inhumanly violent<br>
They grabbed and tore and bit and clawed<br>
At one another and themselves<br><br>

Gravity and death from loss of blood<br>
Had no effect on any member of the crew<br>
During their frantic battle to relief their bodies<br>
From the ether lifting them into the air<br><br>

Die then elevate<br><br>

Fusing remnants of spent bodies<br>
Weaving bones and organs
Into an inverted nest dug in the ceiling<br><br>

The black sludge casting out from the center<br>
As a starving bird of prey<br>
I heard it's voice and felt it's need<br>
To find the child made of teeth,<br>
And begin the human murmuration<br><br>

Calamus will animate<br>
It's contents are hostile<br>
The A.U.M. will kill everybody not in this compound<br>
The dead I bring to them awake,<br>
And join in flight above my head<br><br>

Calamus will animate<br>
It's contents are hostile<br>
The A.U.M. will kill everybody not in this compound<br>
The dead I bring to them awake,<br>
And join in flight above my head<br><br>

It's banshee wail demanding feed<br>
I hear it's pain and become it's keeper<br>
I rip the living from the night<br>
Like pulling worms from soil<br><br>

A.U.M<br>
Watches these sky burials<br><br>

Calamus will animate [2x]<br><br>

The boy lay like a wet mound of dust on the rotting factory floor<br>
I knew the black fluid hid itself in the deformed corpse of this child<br>
Finally, after hours into cutting, lifting, pulling, sawing, crunching, clipping<br>
I had found it<br><br>

My crude autopsy revealed bounty<br>
Nesting in replace of the marrow in the young ones bones<br>
The second I saw it, it saw me<br>
I knew it's face<br>
Changing, relentlessly<br><br>

It was the drip<br>
I had it contained as instructed<br>
Filling up many clusters of hypodermic needles with the matter<br>
I administered it into a new subject each night<br>
A new life<br>
One with every full rotation of the clock<br>
I've seen those hands meet, then disengage a thousand times<br><br>

Calamus will animate<br>
It's contents are hostile<br>
The A.U.M. will kill everybody not in this compound<br>
The dead I bring to them awake,<br>
And join in flight above my head<br><br>

Calamus will animate<br>
It's contents are hostile<br>
The A.U.M. will kill everybody not in this compound<br>
The dead I bring to them awake,<br>
And join in flight above my head<br>
It's banshee wail demanding feed<br>
I hear it's pain and become it's keeper<br><br>

A.U.M allowed me to live off the organs once the people took flight<br>
They do not keep me against my will, yet I refuse to run<br><br>

Every day I climb the stairs outside this door<br>
And view the horde of lifted dead<br>
That they conduct behind the factory walls<br><br>

I must hold on to the final tier of focus I still have<br>
To scribe these happenings in hopes that someone<br>
Will know what went on here<br>
I can feel the pressure of their unified unscripted flight<br>
Pounding air down on the floor board, just a plank's width above<br><br>

I rip the living from the night<br>
Like pulling worms from soil

        <h1 id="rm7" class="lyrics-test">-A Dark Horizontal-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">The dark horizontal.<br>
Ahead, a panting land approaches.<br>
Flaring vibrant coastal glimmers<br>
Mend the distant fraying seams<br>
Of a violent waters restless bedding.<br>
Panic indented in the floating web of wicked mental horrors.<br>
Thought up by the crew's subconscious fears.<br>
Come alive to haunt and drain us.<br><br>

The sea is a man that's trying to kill me.<br>
The wind is his repugnant voice<br>
The air, his fouled breath.<br>
A stench of salt of blood and rot.<br><br>

The sky is his mouth, the stars his open sores.<br>
The shoreline is his jaw, grinding for meat.<br>
Time freezes death inside this altering dark horizontal.<br>
Imaginable realities constructed out of fear.<br><br>

Mountains unstable and hideous.<br>
The guardians of a contorting dimensional paragon.<br>
A.U.M. sent us to find and retrieve the artifact.<br>
In the house of change,<br>
Where the king came back<br>
Through spontaneous regeneration.<br>
Reliving Kairos in the king's hell.<br>
Becoming the mimics from the triplets well.<br>
Exhuming infinity to find a hand.<br>
A child made out of teeth, feeding on blood and sand.<br><br>

The sea is a man that's trying to kill me.<br>
The air, his fouled breath.<br>
A stench of salt, of blood and rot.<br>
The sky, his mouth, the stars, open sores.<br>
The shoreline is his jaw, grinding for meat.<br><br>

The sea is a man that's trying to kill me<br>
The sky is his mouth, the stars, open sores.<br>
The shoreline is his jaw, grinding for...<br>
Time freezes death inside this altering dark horizontal<br>
Imaginable realities constructed out of fear.<br><br>

A dark horizontal<br>
Flooding the linear land with the sand of its own.<br>
In the parallel dunes of its hourglass,<br>
We are buried.<br>
Mountains unstable and hideous.<br>
The guardians of a contorting dimensional paragon.<br>
Raised blades of land stab skyward through the oceans skin.<br>
Storm winds true their edge to scalp the curve of earth.<br>
Peeling off the rind, revealing a house made of living tissue.<br>
Yelling out its mouth for me to regenerate, in it.<br><br>

In dark horizontal.<br>
Ahead, a panting land approaches<br>
Flaring vibrant coastal glimmers<br>
Mend the distant fraying seams.<br>
Of a violent waters restless bedding.<br><br>

In this house the disease of dream<br>
Course in the veins and arteries of the walls.<br>
Imagined infections thrive.<br>
They blister and breed under the floor.<br>
Their many roots are breaking through.<br>
Saplings sprout and secure their place.<br>
Growing into trunks of flesh and boil.<br>
The pillars of man's deepest fears.<br>
Enclosing me in a forest of unforgiving mental genesis.<br>
I mold this house of clay bacterium.<br>
Where I sculpt my own organ prison.<br>
In this house beyond our time, this house at the end of the earth.<br>
The artifacts resting place.<br><br>

A dark horizontal fear, defying the linear<br>
Lost in this storm and exhausted of options<br>
I crawled to the bow of the boat and leaped off it.<br>
The figure head came alive.<br>
And it clawed and it grabbed at me.<br>
Desperately wailing in agony.<br>
Failing to capture my fall. Diving through the fog.<br>
Through the grey and green.<br>
My hands bound together as if in prayer.<br>
I cut through the mesh of black liquid surrounding us.<br>
Fighting against the live current of thousands of eyes and hands.<br>
Miles I swam. Through skin and limb.<br><br>

The sea is a man that's trying to kill me.<br>
The air, his fouled breath. A stench of salt of blood and rot.<br>
The sky, his mouth, the stars, his open sores.<br>
The shoreline is his jaw grinding for meat.<br><br>

The sea is a man that's trying to kill me.<br>
The sky is his mouth, the stars, open sores.<br>
The shoreline is his jaw, grinding for...<br>
Time freezes death inside this altering dark horizontal<br>
Imaginable realities constructed out of fear.
