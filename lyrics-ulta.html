You have opened the gates and discovered this monstrosity.<br>
With such a bloodlust,<br>
an unquenchable thirst it can't foresee.<br>
I beg of you to taste my power,<br>
let me set you free.<br>
<br>
Through the fire these imperfections will be consumed,<br>
and my path of domination at last comes to full fruition.<br>
<br>
Your own people continued to research through the shadows,<br>
prying through dimensions and space.<br>
Transferring items back to their dimension,<br>
for their own personal gain.

            <h1 id="ff10" class="lyrics-test">-Inadequate-</h1>
            <p class="lyrics-test-test">A mere pane of glass to separate my<br>
reality from your own,<br>
future and past playing in perfect harmony.<br>
<br>
Gaze upon my interstellar empire, behold my being.<br>
This utopia I have constructed is at last complete.<br>
Obliterate this inadequate DNA.<br>
Only that which is deemed worthy may stay alive.<br>
<br>
A mere pane of glass to separate my reality from your own,<br>
future and past playing in perfect harmony.<br>
A mere pane of glass to separate my reality from your own,<br>
future and past playing in perfect harmony.<br>
<br>
My victory will be absolute. The only terms of surrender?<br>
The living flesh of every man,<br>
woman, and child will be reaped as the spoils of war.<br>
<br>
Gaze upon my interstellar empire, behold my being.<br>
This utopia I have constructed is at last complete.<br>
Obliterate this inadequate DNA.<br>
Only that which is deemed worthy may stay alive.<br>
<br>
Long dark tendrils,<br>
spiraling towards the core of a glowing sphere.<br>
Is this how all physiological beings came to be?<br>
Excruciating pain,<br>
as I watch liquids erupt from<br>
their eyes and from their orifices.<br>
<br>
Obliterate this inadequate DNA.<br>
Only that which is deemed worthy may stay alive.
