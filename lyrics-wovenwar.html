A shadow even in the dark of night<br>
Scheming your early grave<br>

He's going to leave you dead or dying<br>
Draining all the blood he craves<br>
You never thought you'd be meat for the market<br>
What'd you expect when you sold your name<br>
<br>
You have the chance to rise again<br>
To cast the light that hides within<br>
You have the chance to be a man<br>
To rise again<br>
You have the chance to be a man<br>
So cast the light that hides within<br>
<br>
Oh when courage takes its hold<br>
You face down all the would be masters<br>
And break the ties that bind your goals<br>
<br>
This is going to be the moment<br>
Your blood wakes and fills your veins<br>
Stand tall with your strength defy them<br>
Become your own fate<br>

You have the chance to rise again<br>
To cast the light that hides within<br>
You have the chance to be a man<br>
To rise again<br>
You have the chance to be a man<br>
So cast the light that hides within<br>

Who stands the storm and faces<br>
The horrors that darkness breeds<br>
Who will take the life they're given<br>
And cast light for all to see<br>
<br>
Who stands the storm if not the brave?<br>
What's built from cowards that we praise?<br>
Who stands the storm if not the brave?<br>

You have the chance to rise again<br>
To cast the light that hides within<br>
You have the chance to be a man<br>
To rise again<br>
You have the chance to be a man<br>
So cast the light that hides within

creeping over all the walls we've made<br>
A tragic sly cascade<br>
And I watch it flood away from any candle's flame<br>
With wick entwined of late<br>

Can't keep a fire in rain<br>
<br>
And the worst of it all is that you know me<br>
And you know that I will fall for it every time<br>
When we collide it's death to rights<br>
<br>
Sooner or later we will find new winds<br>
to carry home the hearts we've turned to stone<br>
And I pray they're strong enough to<br>
weather gems from cindered coal that you have left to smoke<br>
<br>
Burned out before the stoke<br>
<br>
And the worst of it all is that you know me<br>
And you know that I will fall for it every time<br>
When we collide it's death to rights<br>

How many will we leave wondering?<br>
<br>
It's starts we never finish<br>
And ends we never start<br>
How many lives will break upon our callous hearts?<br>
Will break upon our callous hearts<br>
<br>
And the worst of it all is that you know me<br>
And you know that I will fall for it every time<br>

The tempest calls for my flight to fail<br>
When gravity beckons with its hold<br>
In spite of all the horizon sends wind to take me home<br>

I'll build my throne from broken bones<br>
Defeats I've known and deeds I left untold<br>

To prove control is so far from undone<br>

We bend, we break, we're forced to heal<br>
The toll it takes in time revealed<br>

A truth is shown to usher in deliverance<br>
For the weight of the past I can't tow<br>
But like the river where the soul is shaped and withers my home<br>
To a place I barely know<br>
<br>
We bend, we break, we're forced to heal<br>
The toll it takes in time revealed<br>
The trial awakes and then creates or tears us down<br>
We bend, we break, we learn to heal<br>
Failings I claim for mason hands to shape<br>
So strike away the grip of past mistakes<br>

It's our downfall<br>
It's our downfall<br>
<br>
Fall in line if you're willing<br>
Defend these shores to the bitter end<br>
Everyone's got a reason<br>
To name the victims and the villains<br>
<br>
Fall in line if you're willing<br>
Defend these shores to the bitter end<br>
Everyone's got a reason<br>
To name the victims and the villains<br>
But who drew lines into the sand?<br>
But who drew lines into the sand?</p>

        <h1 id="s5" class="lyrics-test">-World On Fire-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">The world has lost its mind<br>
These are the liars leading legions of the blind<br>
And no one seems to see the cliff in sight<br>
Are we too far gone to save our lives?<br>
<br>
Our house on sand is sinking<br>
How are we surprised?<br>
Senseless is now a virtue to live by<br>
Fools we are<br>
Drawing from a well run dry<br>
Fools we are<br>
Defending truths we know are lies<br>
<br>
Is there more than just performance in their show?<br>
Either back in the hand you hold or learn to fold<br>
Are we too far gone to change our minds?<br>
Self destruction in the name of progress<br>
Oh, I see the end, I see it<br>
Where do we go from here?<br>
<br>
Because faith is running thin<br>
Just look around the world is on fire</p>

        <h1 id="s6" class="lyrics-test">-Compass-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">My sails are torn and I’m lost at sea<br>
The stars refuse to guide me<br>
The ocean’s churning and I’m burning to see<br>
What horrors await me<br>
Hold my breath<br>
<br>
Waiting, watching for a break in the storm<br>
For a course worth a chance<br>
All I am is whipping in the wind<br>
For too long I’ve let it take me where it will<br>
I see the waves building out of my view<br>
<br>
I see the depths past the blackness<br>
There’s no surprises left to throw at me<br>
What’s another storm to sail?<br>
What’s the difference?<br>
<br>
When the sea has taken all from me<br>
What’s the difference?<br>
I’m indifferent</p>

        <h1 id="s7" class="lyrics-test">-Stones Thrown-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">All the headlines read of tragedies<br>
Force fed to fuel the hate<br>
All the headlines read of tragedies<br>
Stones thrown to separate<br>
Wake up, wake up<br>
A stone thrown to separate<br>
Wake up<br>
All talk is cheap<br>
When from the screen<br>
But we believe it all<br>
<br>
If the mainstream’s reach is what you preach<br>
Whose pockets are you filling?<br>
If the mainstream’s reach is what you preach<br>
Whose pockets are you filling?<br>
Further and further they divide us and conquer<br>
Wake up and stand up, we’re in this together</p>

        <h1 id="s8" class="lyrics-test">-Cascade-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Our time is borrowed and forced<br>
We atrophy in your ascension for more<br>
The writing on the wall is fading<br>
Cascading down and blacking out our light<br>
We atrophy in your ascension for more<br>
The words are weighed to chapters closing<br>
The pages kept the ones who lost their stride<br>
I see you’ve written out the<br>
<br>
lines upon the course you’d have us ride<br>
But what if we refuse to sign?<br>
I won’t follow you down<br>
You fan the flames to torch the future<br>
While I watch you burn it to the ground<br>
You fan the flames to torch the future<br>
I think I found the answer to the question<br>
Maybe moving on is our salvation<br>
It’s pulling teeth to start again<br>
Lines still remain<br>
<br>
Suspend your sentence<br>
An open-ended story you would bind<br>
This ink we bleed is drawn from knowing<br>
You’d lose the plot in trying to survive<br>
Is this a self-fulfilling prophecy?<br>
Is this your self-fulfilling prophecy?</p>

        <h1 id="s9" class="lyrics-test">-Silhouette-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">You’ve got a way of<br>
finding peace in being incomplete<br>
A silhouette you exhibit,<br>
so you’ll never have to claim defeat<br>
Somehow, someway,<br>
<br>
someone found a reason to betray<br>
Maybe I can be your shelter,<br>
maybe I can be safety<br>
But this silhouette you exhibit<br>
will never let you be complete<br>
Somehow, someway,<br>
<br>
someone chose to throw this love…<br>
Away from this<br>
You can find me waiting<br>
When you’re ready<br>
Away from this<br>
<br>
Lay your torment down<br>
I am with you now<br>
Somehow, someway we’ll find a way to love again<br>
Lay your torment down<br>
It’s OK, I’m with you now, I’m with you now</p>

        <h1 id="s10" class="lyrics-test">-Bloodletter-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Blood letter<br>
On a parchment so clean<br>
But day by day the stainless<br>
Fades from white to glory<br>
Blood letter<br>
Penned with pleading hands<br>
A dialect of neglectedness<br>
I’ll never understand<br>
She’s writing red calligraphy<br>
On the razors edge between<br>
Hope and loss and out of ink<br>
Blood letter<br>
<br>
Doesn’t wear it on her sleeve<br>
But knows the brush and depth to cut<br>
To make the canvas bleed<br>
Blood letter<br>
Emblazoned on her skin<br>
A gallery of tempt and pain<br>
For which there is no end<br>
She’s writing red calligraphy<br>
On the razors edge between<br>
Hope and loss and out of ink<br>
A badge of honor<br>
<br>
Or a wound that’s festering<br>
I want to understand<br>
Why won’t she let me in?<br>
A cry for help is now bleeding out<br>
I should have known<br>
That it wasn’t a show<br>
She’s writing red calligraphy<br>
On the razors edge between<br>
Hope and loss and out of ink<br>
A badge of honor<br>
<br>
Or a wound that’s festering<br>
I want to understand<br>
Why won’t she let me in?<br>
A cry for help is now bleeding out</p>

        <h1 id="s11" class="lyrics-test">-130-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Explosions shake the city<br>
I thought it was part of the show<br>
A craven is screaming prayers<br>
In a tongue that I don’t know<br>
Paris lights are winking out<br>
I can hear the city scream<br>
While the faithful are rejoicing<br>
In the sound of tragedy<br>
<br>
Find me one reason worth this hate<br>
One reason worth this endless violence<br>
Find me more one reason worth this hate<br>
Because I have 130 reasons to change<br>
This stage should be a temple<br>
Where anyone can sing<br>
Yet we are one divided<br>
Waging war over beliefs<br>
Paris lights are winking out<br>
I can hear the city scream<br>
<br>
While the faithful are rejoicing<br>
In the sound of tragedy<br>
Find me one reason worth this hate<br>
One reason worth this endless violence<br>
Find me more one reason worth this hate<br>
Because I have 130 reasons to change<br>
Parents’ cries are ringing out<br>
<br>
While their sons and daughters bleed<br>
And the faithful are rejoicing<br>
In the sound of tragedy</p>
