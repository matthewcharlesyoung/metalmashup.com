As if you were a monument<br>
Reaching high like a tower to hell<br>
And the ground concedes<br>

Pulled from the earth like rotting roots<br>

Dragged from the depths of a dying world<br>

For what a brush with death has shown me<br>
I will trust in Your grace<br>
That speaks of the end<br>

I know Your blood was the bridge<br>

I’ve witnessed this before<br>
Patience was fleeting<br>
If a thousand coins on the ocean<br>

I’ll wait forever<br>
<br>
Fill the sea with dreams of a wishing well<br>
Waves bring back my coins to me<br>
Drain the deep that teems with my empty shells<br>
Slaves of sand still call for me<br>
<br>
I once had love to give<br>
I once had hoped to live<br>
The rarest stones will break my bones<br>
And golden salt stops my lungs<br>
The perfect limbs and haunting eyes<br>
Begs the seas: begin to rise<br>

And when these delusions come to fruition<br>
Believe you me<br>
I'll strangle my self into nothingness, nothingness<br>
And be reborn from the dream of a blasphemous fool<br>
In my sordid pelt of mold<br>
I’ll earn back years to me<br>
The god of a nightmare will fall<br>
As I take back what is…<br>

Mine!<br>
Worthless swine<br>
Enraptured by my vanity<br>
Your soul sank under the weight<br>
Of gold you offered me<br>

A waste of a life, squandered my heart until it rests<br>
On the ocean floor, barren<br>
Watching the light descend<br>
Deeper and deeper<br>
A deadening feeling starts to grow in my ribs<br>
From where I lie<br>
<br>
([Devil:] From where I hide)<br>
[Man:] The waves overflow<br>
([Devil:] The snakes overgrown)<br>
[Man:] With my blood<br>
([Devil:] With your blood)<br>

[Man:]<br>
Where are my years?<br>
I’ll bleed dry by myself<br>
I wish I was someone<br>

Somewhere between bearing my shame<br>

You still find it in you to love me<br>

When I fall prey to the snares of distrust<br>
You're reaching out or I'd be crushed<br>
Break my fears and shatter my guilt<br>
An eternity of weight is gone<br>

I never cease to fail you<br>
But you still love me past my debt<br>

You sow life in the deepest of graves<br>

(For miles) I see no end to your flowing grace<br>
You sow life in the deepest of graves<br>

Have my veins run dry?<br>
Will I ever hear your voice again<br>
or feel your healing hand?<br>

Cut me away from the lies that this world has fed me<br>

A mere fraction of a note in eternal stanzas<br>

To breathe before my last and begin beginning<br>
Would you catch the wind with your arm<br>
Or lift my oceans with a heave<br>
All hell sound your sirens<br>
Hold your breath for three words conceived:<br>
It is finished<br>
Walking down the streets i watch you turn your face from me<br>
They ripped the skin from my back dissecting eternity<br>
You clothed me in darkness given a rose but wearing the thorns instead<br>
My last breath<br>
I watch god hang his robes over the sun<br>
To hide a child becoming corruption<br>
Clean hands<br>
Eternity nailed to a tree how tired you must have been<br>
Clean hands<br>
From a garden to misery bearing the weight of men<br>
Yet you raise yourself higher to take your last breath<br>
Demons pause with terror<br>
I am blood enough to never run dry still you despise me<br>
Sinking the spear in my side when you hung beside me on that day<br>
Cursing at the wind will not stop the message i send<br>
<br>
Clean hands<br>
Eternity nailed to a tree how tired You must have been<br>
Clean hands<br>
From a garden to misery bearing the weight of men<br>
Yet You raise yourself higher to take Your last breath<br>
<br>
Bear witness once and for all<br>
It is finished<br>
<br>
Would you catch the wind with your arm<br>
Or lift my oceans with a heave<br>
All hell sound your sirens<br>
Hold your breath for three words conceived</p>

Blood stains the floor where I lay in separate halves<br>
Trapped inside my mind my head welcomed the ground<br>
Cursing in vain but my words offer no sound<br>

I am lost in the spiral<br>
My shame is stronger than desire for survival<br>
An angel pushed me when I was pulling away<br>
Despite my best attempts she decided to stay<br>
Trapped in the cracks of an empty shell<br>
On borrowed time that was spent in hell<br>
The sum of all my fears strung out over seven long, long years<br>
<br>
Drugs traverse my veins and leave me clutching the numb<br>
My voice flies away further from my useless tongue<br>
I sit quiet and still and hear worms eating the church<br>
Maybe I believe them but I’m drunk from drinking my words<br>

Let loose the words you’re free, come back, come back to me<br>
Speak the words tonight, span the void inside<br>
Let loose the words you’re free, come back, come back to me<br>

Seven years without a voice seven months away from my side<br>
Seven spirals into the void but it ends now, it ends tonight<br>

I won’t drag you down anymore<br>
I am more than dead weight floating adrift<br>
But I could never feel it brush my lips<br>
You ask me to span the void inside<br>
But I believe my borrowed time’s run dry<br>
I won’t drag your down anymore<br>
Speak!<br>

I wear my past as the scars on my feet<br>
Seven years without a voice seven months away from my side<br>
Seven spirals into the void but it ends now, it ends tonight<br>

Forced to fear<br>
By burden of indoctrination<br>
A weight upon their eyelids<br>
Asleep to the outside<br>
The apotheosis of madness<br>
Paints red a nation<br>
Free will is a death sentence<br>
There's no salvation<br>

Mourn when I say mourn<br>
Or make your graves with the resistance<br>
Bow when I say bow<br>
Or fade in a vacuum of nonexistence<br>

When light can't reach into shadow<br>

Peel back what covers your ears<br>
Hear that a nation is crying out for mercy<br>
Before it's too late for them to raise a sound<br>

<br>
I am waiting to die among a swarm of flies<br>
Every day is a lifetime in chains<br>
Every day<br>
<br>
Hold fast to hope of another day<br>
Hold fast it can't last forever<br>
The meaningless names of far off places<br>
I have to believe something better awaits<br>
<br>
I have to believe. I have to believe</p>

            <h1 id="ff12" class="lyrics-test">-Know Death; Know Forever-</h1>
            <p class="lyrics-test-test">I had to be broken<br>
to be pieced back together<br>
I had to know death to know forever<br>
<br>
An angel hiding in the hearts of a stone<br>
And the sculptor's patient means<br>
Cutting through rubble to the bone<br>
To carve her into being<br>
The unsung and lonely orphan<br>
And the namer of names<br>
A refuge and father given<br>
Granting title, will, and claim<br>
<br>
Broken; pieced back together<br>
Know death; know forever<br>
<br>
When sorrows rise<br>
The thorns in my side<br>
Make me alive<br>
I wear my scars like a crown<br>
I had to be lost to be found<br>
<br>
Oh captive wearer of chains<br>
And the holder of keys<br>
Deliver ankles and wrists from pain<br>
To abound as eternally free<br>
<br>
Broken to be pieced back together<br>
I had to know death to know forever<br>
<br>
When sorrows rise<br>
The thorns in my side<br>
Make me alive<br>
I wear my scars like a crown<br>
I had to be lost to be found<br>
<br>
Broken before the maker<br>
All death will know forever<br>
<br>
I wear my scars like a crown<br>
I had to be lost to be found</p>
