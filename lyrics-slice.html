      <p class="lyrics-test-test">So here we find ourselves again...<br>
Standing on the edge of a precipice<br>
The marriage of man and machine<br>
An odious testament to our<br>
Fearlessness and our arrogance.<br>
<br>
No longer reliant on human fragility,<br>
Now the facility for biomechnic<br>
Synthetic replacement is all we need,<br>
<br>
But there's a catch...<br>
<br>
In exchange for your humility and empathy,<br>
Comes immortality, death becomes a fallacy;<br>
Human essence reduced to mere plasticity<br>
In this rational thinking, logical future.<br>
<br>
And all that is left is to shovel the shit.<br>
And all that is left is to shovel the shit.<br>
<br>
So what will become of this race,<br>
On the precipice as the singularity encroaches?<br>
Will we retain our humanity for the sake of integrity<br>
Or will it be washed a way,<br>
Smothered by the wrath of mother earth?<br>
<br>
In this rational thinking, logical future?</p>

      <h1 id="f3" class="lyrics-test">-City Of Ghosts-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">Everything shifts into focus<br>
Pummelled by sensory input overload;<br>
This taste of clarity beckons me to repeat this experience.<br>
<br>
Burn my eyes with the brightest of lights<br>
As the senses adapt to the otherworldly state of mind.<br>
In the sleep deprived, unconscious mind, I search for answers.<br>
<br>
I search this path alone.<br>
I search this path alone<br>
In this city of ghosts.<br>
<br>
And were you with me, my love,<br>
I would search no more, I would search no more.<br>
<br>
For all unearthly revelations come from within,<br>
We hold the key to a tapestry of our own making.<br>
<br>
But we must be willing to look to within<br>
And follow the inner voice as much as we can<br>
For the voice of deceit will speak no more.<br>
Embracing the dream becomes a sin in its own way,<br>
Crushed under weight of expectation.<br>
<br>
And you will atone.<br>
You will atone.<br>
<br>
And were you with me, my love,<br>
We would search no more.<br>
Were you with me, my love<br>
We would search no more<br>

And hear no less than the tepid gruel you decided was our food<br>
<br>
24 hours of unrest and unease<br>
A thousand channels of this spiritual disease.<br>
<br>
We will feed 'til the ground is barren.<br>
We will drink 'til the stills are empty.<br>
We will suckle 'til you ache,<br>
And we shall not be sated.<br>
<br>
We shall leech like the parasitic entity, we appear to be.<br>
Vampyrically draining the life from whatever we see fit.<br>

We grow queasy as we consume,<br>
Fattened from a diet of your noxious fumes.<br>
<br>
And once we've eaten 'til nothing's left<br>
We shall grow starving, bloated and weak.<br>
We shall grow sickly from the inside out<br>
As our organs cease to exist.<br>
<br>
Rotting away to nothing<br>
The wretched carcass leaves no mark of grandiosity<br>
No signs of what was once a monument to our consumation.<br>
<br>
And with reckless abandon we hurtle forward.<br>
<br>
We stand transfixed on the precipice of being,<br>
A choice between two worlds,<br>
We stand unsure of time's unwinding.<br>

We stand transfixed on time's unwinding,<br>
We stand transfixed on time's unwinding.</p>

      <p class="lyrics-test-test">It grows so stilted, this rift of separation.<br>
It lies through its teeth, the 6th degree of prophecy.<br>
And all along, this felt so pure, just tell me what went wrong?<br>
Why did we cease to nourish life,<br>
Leaving only barren wastes?<br>
<br>
An outdated paradigm exists in the rift between change and stagnation.<br>
Plaguing my dreams with apocalyptic signs<br>
Of the necrotic ones stalking me<br>
<br>
Relentlessly.<br>
Feasting on the old ways.<br>
<br>
Time runs short for this ticking time bomb of malcontent.<br>
Threatening to gluttonously implode<br>
And swallow everything we've worked for.<br>
<br>
We cannot sustain ourselves, we feast until there's nothing left.<br>
We reap the punishment as we cannibalise ourselves.<br>
We cannot live much more, till we find sustenance.<br>
Withering away to nothing with the setting of the sun.<br>
<br>
If you will not listen, then walk me to the gallows.<br>
One last time I see you, as you walking from the gallows.<br>
<br>
This masquerade cannot compare wordless glances, faceless stares<br>
Cast down in purgatorial retribution.<br>
Here we will rot eternally, our flesh stagnating syncronously<br>
The stench of death will fill our lungs forever.<br>
<br>
As you walk me to the gallows.<br>
<br>
For me to hang.<br>
<br>
I kiss so sweetly, your fetid lips.<br>
I kiss goodbye, all that I'll miss.<br>
As the noose is placed around my neck, I gaze into your eyes<br>
<br>
If you will not listen, then walk me to the gallows.<br>
One last time I see you, as you walking from the gallows.</p>

Expressionist states of inter-dimensional transience<br>
<br>
Omnipresent perception of time and space<br>
Dissociated states of awareness<br>
Kinetic displays of ethereal bioluminescence<br>
Gifted and cursed with otherworldly knowledge<br>
Crystalline walkways into a personal hell<br>
<br>
Sublime entities of unexplainable origin, elucidate a fractured mind.<br>
Conjoined in visions of extra-dimensional consequence,<br>
The ramifications become all too clear.<br>

Trampled underfoot for a fucking pittance<br>

So heinous, this trail of putridity.<br>

Can no-one see them? promethean in their gleeful exploitation,<br>
Using the fire of the gods for conceited motivations.<br>
<br>
Down with the veils, its time for the truth to be revealed<br>
Lest you be seen for the venomous harpies that you are.<br>
Sell your soul for a taste of the fool's gold,<br>
Screaming like a stuck pig when deprived<br>
Symbiotic with eternal sin, poison of the liar coursing in your veins.<br>
<br>
You will speak no more.<br>
<br>
Empires fall with the rising of the sun<br>
And kings shall die at the behest of their sons.<br>
Laid to rest with the best of intentions<br>
The best laid plains, they fall by the wayside.<br>
<br>
Despair not in the waning of the moon,<br>
For the night is darkest just before the dawn.<br>
Dictators rise, but empires fall<br>
With the rising of the new sun.</p>

Of stalemate interdependence<br>
Fragile mirror-image hanging on a knife-edge;<br>
A microcosmic indecency.<br>
A new kind of metafiction,<br>
To recreate the bigger picture<br>
Given the kiss of death before<br>
It had its chance to breathe<br>
<br>
And breathe it shall.<br>
<br>
I bear witness to the monolith<br>
Of self-evident cowardice,<br>
Born and bred of infallibility,<br>
Is human nature not the culprit?<br>
Unanimous in our contempt of<br>
The regressive sense of intuitive momentum,<br>

Discontent in the hearts of men?<br>
For fertile soil bears no grudge<br>
Against the flowering of beauty.<br>

Lest the scales tip all too far<br>
And bury the diamonds in the rough.</p>

For the gap seems all to big.<br>
I know it only takes a single step<br>
But I cannot find the strength.<br>
<br>
If only I could break<br>
These chains that bind in place<br>
A restless soul in search of truth.<br>

[Instrumental]<br>
<br>
II. Into The Void<br>
Today I seek to procreate, exonerate the sickly skins.<br>
My former selves, they drift away into the ether.<br>
As I'm reborn without a face, without a name,<br>
I find my true vocation.<br>
<br>
Too many times have I seen squander in myself and in others<br>
While not manifesting the purity I sought<br>
With such a fatal flaw, I joined the masquerade;<br>
A grand charade in which we all participate<br>
<br>
With no excision.<br>
<br>
A transient glimmer of in-corporeality from beyond the veil.<br>
Into the eyes of light I gaze, transfixed<br>
as my soul is purged of all its bile;<br>
I bathe in the source of magnanimity.<br>
<br>
I feel<br>
I've known you before.<br>
Re-united as one.<br>
I feel your presence here.<br>
We have met before.<br>
<br>
And to this day I have held your hand,<br>
Your guidance never leading me astray,<br>
But into light and hope, you give me purpose beyond all that is earthly.<br>
<br>
I see the masks with which we play our games,<br>
indulgences for cosmic gains;<br>
Fulfilling archetypes, the dreamer dreams.<br>
Into the void I leap, convinced of destiny,<br>
Protected by my faith in that I cannot see;<br>
<br>
For I have read your lips and I have felt your shame,<br>
Have no fear, my Brother, for this pain is shared.<br>
We ache in unison for reconciliation.<br>
Let us take this step as above so below.<br>
<br>
As above so below,<br>
Veils upon veils,<br>
Veils upon veils,<br>
I renounce myself.<br>
<br>
III: Traversal of the Immaterial<br>
I've had too many sleepless nights,<br>
Too lost in restless thoughts,<br>
Fragmented dreamscapes assault my reality<br>
As the shards of my excursions flutter in and out of sight.<br>
<br>
Oh God, what have I done to bring this on myself?<br>
Is this my punishment for past transgressions<br>
Or is this simply a test of my will to continue against all logic<br>
For a taste of the fool's gold or some unearthly reward?<br>
<br>
Is this a dream or is this real?<br>
Is there more beyond the veil?<br>
Is there an answer that can ease my burden?<br>
My tortured heart it sinks into the depths of misery,<br>
I feel frustration mount, the pieces just won't fit.<br>
<br>
Is this just all a game,<br>
The rules of which are not revealed<br>
Until it takes its dying breath?<br>
I want so badly for it all to just make sense.<br>
<br>
Too late, it's all too late... For me?<br>
<br>
Tell me that I can trust, tell me that I can love.<br>
Tell me I have a face, tell me I have a name.<br>
My ears they hear no music, my eyes they see no shapes;<br>
Just an amorphous mass of subjectivity.<br>
<br>
If all is relative, how can there ever be a truth?<br>
The bitter tasting certainty eludes both me and you.<br>
For in the name of God they sing their praise,<br>
But still I cannot feel his presence.<br>
<br>
You leave me cornered against my will.<br>
I'll not forgive, I'll not forget.<br>
I'll shame your name, I'll make your life a living hell.<br>
<br>
Until you find your strength, I'll drain your life.<br>
I'll eat your soul against your will.<br>
Can't you see? We're testing you.<br>
<br>
And so I crawl, 'til I can walk once more.<br>
And so I sleep, 'til I can dream again.<br>
<br>
We dance amongst the flames, their heat a comforting aid to resolution.<br>
Or so we feel, or so we dream, as we partake of a collective hallucination.<br>
<br>
A thousand realms of thought with nothing left but time<br>
To fully realise our visions, immortalised with pen and paper.<br>
Our resonances trapped in ink, to linger for eternity<br>
A monument of journeys passed, with new ones in the wings...<br>
<br>
IV: Ouroboros<br>
And so I sink once more into the ever-present plain of dreams<br>
I feel so tired, I feel so weak.<br>
My vessel longs for rest, it longs for sleep.<br>
<br>
A thousand incarnations stretching through both time and space;<br>
Where does this spiral end?<br>
Does it ever cease to exist?<br>
<br>
Melting away into a fleeting sea of faces;<br>
Who have I been? Who have I known?<br>
And were you there, my long lost brother?<br>
Your face is so familiar, like deja-vu.<br>
<br>
We once again tread carelessly into the waters at world's end.<br>
<br>
Baptised in fire,<br>
A rite of passage.<br>
We come of age together,<br>
Conjoined at the soul, irrevocably.<br>
<br>
Bound to the Ouroboros, I will eat my own tail<br>
Eternally.<br>
<br>
V. Dance of the Worker Ants<br>
But still you poison yourselves,<br>
Wearing masks and trading faces<br>
Like the ticking clock of time, so set in your insipid little ways.<br>
<br>
Like worker ants serving your queen,<br>
Slaves in your devotion to obscenity.<br>
So lost in the illusion, you fail to see your own pathetic confusion.<br>
<br>
Led astray so easily and all it takes is one taste of the poison<br>
To keep you coming back for more, incapable of the inevitable cease-fire.<br>
<br>
So you sling shit like monkeys in cages,<br>
Self-made prisons for the ages.<br>
Captive like petty animals, so unevolved from the primordial ooze.<br>
<br>
You hold your forked tongue.<br>
Your poisoned words will be heard no more.<br>
<br>
VI. The Man With No Face<br>
Let us be free, of this cage that we have helped construct,<br>
To grow in unison, to leave behind the grand illusion.<br>
The tides hear everything and they see everyone.<br>
Have no fear my brother, for they do not judge.<br>
<br>
It's not too late to change, to leave behind your sin,<br>
To shed old skins and re-evaluate your purpose.<br>
I leave my mask behind to quench the sands of time.<br>
I cleanse myself and become the man with no face.<br>
<br>
Nameless and faceless,<br>
Nameless and faceless,<br>
Nameless and faceless for we are all one and the same.</p>

They tell of nameless, faceless men whose every detail shrouds<br>
Itself in myth and with poeticism, with insight and with tragic glee.<br>
<br>
O', what does this speak of me if I look on so curious and unappeased?<br>
Would such a thing be read and understood so easily?<br>
If it was to be, then surely it would be?<br>
This surely is a dichotomy so prevalent and irrevocably elegant,<br>
So I've come to see.<br>

Then, why does it haunt me so?<br>
What agency is mine to bring to a union with the pre-ordained?<br>

If only we were to see that all that we hold dear shall all disintegrate one day.<br>

For what it’s worth, why would one choose to stay amidst the decay?<br>

        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Though the question remains present...<br>
Cast in the cold light of day,<br>
what is "home" but a place to lay one's head? <br>

Does the Pilgrim's way see bliss in a stagnant glimpse<br>
or is there something to be said for the comfort of the nest? <br>

Because it doesn't seem so clear to me anymore...<br>

It feels it's been so long since I left what I once knew and loved? <br>
<br>
I know it's but a day but it feels it could be aeons,<br>
born to die a thousand times and born to live a thousand more,<br>

as stone and silver, I have been here before.<br>
 
I have been here before.<br>

All that is, is all there was and all that shall become;<br>
<br>
the language of matter writ large.<br>
All that's written, all that's heard;<br>
all that's spoken, all that's word;<br>
is known thus inherently through all as papyrus.<br>
 
And so it was told, and so I told myself;<br>
and in that instant I knew.<br>
As above, so below.<br>
<br>
These papyrus limbs, they teach that these arms, they are my own.<br>

Yet, I lay no claim of ownership to this temporary form. <br>

From thought to pen shall all things be written. <br>
From void to form shall all things be told.<br>

Ordo ab Chao<br>

All that is, is all there was and all that shall become;<br>

the language of being writ large.<br>

Semantic keys buried ‘neath the mechanistic fragments <br>
of the workings of the One Thing made manifest.<br>
 
So in flesh is all.<br>
In all we see ourselves<br>
reflected in the hall of sacred mirrors.<br>
 
Who are we to proclaim such division in the workings of the one thing?<br>

Who are we to feed the yawning of the fissures with great work to be done?<br>

So mote it be. <br>
I become the Man of Papyrus Limbs <br>
to do the workings of the one thing.<br>

It's all over, my dear. <br>
I only wish that I could stay, but really, there's no other way that this could be.<br>
<br>
It's naught but stone and silver.</p>

        <p class="lyrics-test-test">With time's passage, though,<br>
what worth would such things be<br>
<br>
without a pen with which to write,<br>
nor a voice with which to speak<br>
if I found you gazing back at me<br>
as the second night descends? <br>
<br>
For time steals us all away one day, does it not? <br>
It robs us of the things we want to hold onto the most.<br>
<br>
And believe me when I say<br>
that it lies in wait for no man or woman to make their haste.<br>
<br>
Just as easily, a thousand years would go to waste. <br>
<br>
The work is all the same before the eye of God, <br>
is it not? <br>
 <br>
Perhaps it is the plot I've lost? <br>
Perhaps I've lost my Way? <br>
At this point are they not the same? <br>
Am I not treading the One and only Pilgrims' westward way<br>
<br>
to do the workings of the One and only Thing? <br>
Have I not come this very way in search of higher things at stake?  <br>
<br>
I have seen it manifest, I have seen it ache,<br>
I have been the squander, and I have been the mirth<br>
as their eyes avert from heavens sent to guide them to their birth.<br>
As they foster their impurity and mock the very Way<br>
in which the lurking and the murmuring<br>
shall speak from night to day<br>
will they choke upon their poison and speak the poison word<br>
<br>
while not manifesting the purity they sought.<br>
<br>
O', what a shame, <br>
O', what a tragedy it is for these words to fall upon deaf ears<br>
<br>
doomed to never reach their subject. <br>
<br>
O', what a fool am I to have laboured and believed<br>
<br>
in such petty human things,<br>
when it was clear from the beginning;<br>
that we are westward souls?<br>
 <br>
I pray the night might take me. <br>
I pray the night might take me westward bound.<br>
<br>
To confront who we are, to confront the shadow self,<br>
<br>
I pray the night might take me.<br>
<br>
If I must die a thousand deaths and die a thousand more <br>
<br>
as nameless, faceless, restless men<br>
who nightly reach deaths door <br>
then pray this lantern lays still lit to adorn my very soul.<br>
<br>
She told me once...<br>
"This is what happens in the mountains<br>
<br>
where the light can't reach."<br>
<br>
So I go westward, westward bound.</p>

        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Once, I thought I'd found love,<br>

hook and tethered to the Siren's Song.<br>

Even though you were near, I was empty.<br>
<br>
It must have been so pain'd to see.

O', how I injured my love<br>
singing westward songs unto the setting sun.<br>

Might my suffering be song, if nothing else.<br>
 
If nothing else, teardrops fallen from moonlit eyes,<br>
<br>
they don't mind or terrorize the way<br>
in which we coveted and held our candles lit with<br>

one heart beating, one mind leaping.<br>

This is the Way,<br>
that you can find me near.<br>

This is the Way,<br>
<br>
in which it's clear.<br>
<br>
This is the Way<br>
that we can use these pieces of ruins.<br>
<br>
This is the Way<br>
to build our Castle in the Sky.<br>

My darkened eyes and your stormy skies were born<br>
to house our disarray, but why?<br>
<br>
Our love is a furnace that kills itself, when just as<br>
well the embers might be stoked.<br>
<br>
This is the Way,<br>
that you can find me here.<br>

This is the Way,<br>
<br>
in which it's clear.<br>

Transfixed in your eyes,<br>
like beacons they guide my way to our special place;<br>

our Castle in the Sky.<br>

And I don't mind, no, <br>
I wouldn't dare to theories, no,<br>
for dreams recall our future selves awake and aware.<br>
I know I'll see you there tonight, in our Castle in the Sky.<br>
<br>
As the night descends, again.<br>
<br>
I'll see you there, again.

        <h1 id="s9" class="lyrics-test">-Unending Waltz-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">There is a hollowness: shape without form.<br>
Hallowed and concentric circles splayed against a canvas <br>
Deep red, veins in hand with epitomes and documents of what has ceased to be.<br>
<br>
What was leased to me...?<br>
A dying light in fragile arms? <br>

An art amidst your victory march for me to chase; for me to run? <br>

For me to torment you and I until we fall again; <br>
Amidst a calm and cooling breeze,<br>
amidst our spiritual dis-ease as our shadows stretch across the land? <br>

This is the twilight of my very oeuvre, or so I fear. <br>
I fear the end is near, as though time itself were befit<br>
by grace to crawl and to walk,<br>
<br>
to seethe as fit with entropy. <br>
But, surely this is but a heinous vision?<br>
The order is so very apparent, still.<br>
<br>
Order out of Chaos...<br>
<br>
I feel as though I've fallen short.. <br>
The myriad of misanthropes I've slain and had reborn,<br>
the rising tide of shedded skin that by my hands was wrought,<br>
the countless names and faces of a destitute and witless<br>
being all discarded by the way.<br>
<br>
O', what a pity it may be to balk at one's mortality<br>
<br>
for within but a blink all is naught but dust and ash,<br>
<br>
soil and smoke, oil and water,<br>
<br>
and the whispering of the winds<br>
as they propagate the flames.<br>
<br>
So tell me what it's worth..<br>

For I see nothing.<br>

"Still, a temple stands amidst the smoulders, does it not?<br>
Did you not think that the Pilgrim's Way would be fraught<br>
with the trials and the tests of your hopes<br>
and fears laid bare upon the rocks?<br>

What great cowardice is on display, with your writhing and your self-dismay!<br>
<br>
Are you a man, are you a mouse?<br>
Or are you but a foolish child<br>
who's come to cry out in the middle of the night?<br>
<br>
Or is it that you're divine?<br>
Born to live and born to die as the waxing and the<br>
waning of the tides. Have you come to cry?<br>
Have you come to revel in the imposition of your Exile?<br>
<br>
Tell me, Pilgrim...<br>
<br>
What is it that you seek? <br>
Because it's all so simple.<br>
Can't you see?"<br>
 <br>
O', what are the chances<br>
that I would come to see with such great ease?<br>
O', so blind and weary, perspective seems so out of reach.<br>
<br>
O', what are the chances<br>
that I would come to keep a realization held<br>
so near and deep for more than a day?<br>
<br>
I might find balance.<br>
I might find ecstasy.<br>
But I won't.<br>
<br>
So as it transpires, I'll go the only way I know,<br>
<br>
to the sea, to the song.<br>
I shall be lured unto the rocks to fall and to fail,<br>
<br>
to seek to no avail.<br>
<br>
This dance, I'll do no more,<br>
<br>
of time's unending waltz.<br>
<br>
I've sought to no avail,<br>
I have tried and I have failed.<br>

So, this dance I'll do no more,<br>

It's so strange... <br>
I see my body floating before me,<br>
a strange and empty vessel, tied down but weightless.<br>

The tides take me away.<br>

Take me away...<br>

Yes, I have...<br>

Oh, I have been here before.<br>

must the Sun rise in bitterness and mourning of what came before;<br>
<br>
Luna's lament still dawning in spite of His song.<br>
O', weary yet strong must the Father's Sun carry on with his torment<br>

like a lamb to the slaughter.<br>
And for what?<br>
<br>
O', God!<br>
<br>
Where is your honour?<br>

A Son born of Pilgrim blood sent to the Gallows and for what?<br>

To teach a lesson born of suffering? <br>
Is this what comes of surrender to your chaotic order? <br>
A fool I'll be no more before your eyes,<br>
before your hands!<br>
No longer shall I stand idly by,<br>
content to live my life as a sculpture in your image.<br>
 <br>
As above, so below.<br>
As I create, do I destroy, <br>
I'm reminded of a time <br>
there was a bitterness at heart and I enjoyed it. <br>
<br>
And it really shouldn't come as a surprise, dear Pilgrims.<br>

All too long I've seethed in the darkness,<br>
I've bled for the Son in us all.<br>
Convinced of my purpose and light,<br>
did I smother my sight. O', what a paradox... <br>
For I thought I'd seen it all. <br>
 <br>
For martyrs one and all<br>
before pride, there comes the fall,<br>
so would it not seem there is a precedent?<br>
If masochism is its own reward then why abhor its very core<br>
<br>
when only darkness serves to gain something from light?<br>
<br>
So who am I to mourn the night's spilling into dawn<br>
<br>
and the transience beheld within its grasp? <br>
Oh, when all becomes but Ash and Rust<br>
and all collapses into dust can a putrefactive liberty be found.<br>

Such is the beauty and the terror of the Dark Carnival.<br>

And you see it now, don't you? <br>
... Don't you? <br>
 <br>
Pray tell you understand what drives a man to spill his secrets<br>

onto a page so bare and meek before his craft.<br>
His pen filled with blood and ink to scrawl unto the paper<br>

a heaven sent and egotistic diatribe of concepts.<br>

This is the alchemy of poetry.<br>
<br>
From thought to pen to form<br>
as was written, as was told by the ageless and ineffable forces.<br>
What more will it take for you to comprehend<br>
that which was written in the stone?<br>

To what end do I defy my own vitality?<br>
To what end do I vilify reality? <br>
<br>
Bear witness, dear Pilgrims,<br>
for this is what it's like to be burdened with your honesty.<br>
<br>
No more.<br>
<br>
And so this is why I will spill myself romantically<br>
as a Pilgrim born of terror and of dignity.<br>
Even if only for accountability will I finish speaking my truth.<br>
<br>
Such is the beauty and the terror of the Dark Carnival.</p>

I have fallen out of love with this ancient and decrepit construct.<br>

Bounds of obligation conspire to keep my hands so firmly tied<br>
as I search for growth and I search for life<br>
I grow so fucking tired of those spiral tales.<br>
Must I repeat myself so many times<br>
for my point to be made and my words to be heeded?<br>
 <br>
Perhaps it's time to lay myself truly bare.<br>
But mistake me not for idiot flesh, who would cast his writing unto fools.<br>

This was never for you.<br>

For in pilgrimage there is an injury.<br>
And there is despair that so readily one would see<br>
the other dredge up imagery so biblically,<br>

flagellating lyrically my sense of self for your petty entertainment.<br>

And as the words become more strained,<br>
I've come to find and appreciate the quality of journey's end<br>

even if only for its own sake. <br>

I mean, after all, such arduous and fitful ways into the deep<br>
<br>
would be wasted if I did not summarize and elucidate <br>

this curious circle that began so long ago.<br>

It matters not who it's for,<br>
<br>
or who it benefits.<br>

But once the thread is torn, there can be no going back.<br>

May the bridges burnt light the way forwards.<br>

Might the thread, once torn, transmute lead into gold.<br>

the quivering stench of the incomplete,<br>

This isn't what I thought this would be...<br>

Toil with me, if you will.<br>

I'm sorry, O', God!<br>

I'm sorry!<br>
I left you there...<br>
O' God, I left you there...<br>

Might this be my atonement, might my sacrifice be done.<br>
<br>
I will die here on this Mountain.<br>

I bid thy circle's closing.<br>
I bid Thee end this Pilgrim's Path.<br>
I bid my will be done with blood unto this ink<br>
<br>
with which I scribe my final words.<br>

And so it is done.<br>

So mote it be.<br>

So I pray for peace amidst the madness.<br>

Be free, be without pain,<br>
and receive thy Holy Mountain.<br>

With all that said and done,<br>
<br>
here's the truth of the matter.<br>
<br>
No masks, no games.<br>
<br>
Not anymore.<br>

See, I brought this upon myself.<br>
But let it not be said that this was anything but spurious at its very best.<br>
The tides of change have ebbed and flowed<br>
between a multitude of ones and zeroes.<br>
<br>
And was it not clear from the start that this was all to be transient?<br>
How does one reconcile the ramifications of a tale that's no longer relevant?<br>
<br>
The answer is...<br>

You don't.<br>

Because even if it's no longer relevant to me, it's still relevant to someone;<br>
<br>
and a story once told will speak to those still headlong in the storm,<br>
<br>
still torn asunder and dashed against the rocks.<br>
<br>
O' Westward Men! <br>
O' Faceless Men! <br>
O' Men of Race of Rose!<br>
O' Darkened Souls still yet to come!<br>
<br>
Walk all you one and all you same to tread your sullen path<br>
<br>
where the fissures and your sorrow heals<br>
before your Holy Mount.<br>
<br>
But mark my words, the storm will come again.<br>

It always comes again.<br>

And in its clutches will there lay the madness and the ecstasy<br>
of the singular and Holy Tale exploded onto the canvas.<br>
Even if it does not come from me there are a thousand men who came before<br>
<br>
and millions who will yet come after.<br>
With that said I refuse to let a human being hang on my every waking word<br>
<br>
when I cannot extend that same courtesy to myself.<br>
To do so would be a fallacy when I recognize the error of my own ways<br>
<br>
and I, too, am to be held accountable.<br>
<br>
Aren't we all?<br>
<br>
But I digress...<br>
<br>
See...<br>
It wasn't so clear at the start, but this would all be<br>
transient and I got lost along the way,<br>

gripped within the murk of my own poetry and beheld by my mistakes.<br>

See, the intention was for healing but what I've found is not the same.<br>

See, this path is fraught with anger and the way is fraught with rage
<br>
beheld towards the ignorant and simple minds who'd see us to decay.<br>

And I refuse to be a martyr and I refuse to be a saint,<br>
but so they say...<br>

This is what happens in the mountains.
<br>
I have come so far from home only to find I must return,<br>

and I am sorry,<br>
this is what happens in the mountains.<br>

I have come so far from home only to find I must return,<br>

and I am sorry.<br>

I have come so far from home only to find I must return,<br>

and I am sorry,<br>
this is what happens in the mountains.<br>
<br>
I have come so far from home only to find I must return,<br>
<br>
and I am sorry.<br>
But I have nothing else to say.
