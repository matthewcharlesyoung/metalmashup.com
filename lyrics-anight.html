      <p class="lyrics-test-test">I have lived only<br>
to torture the souls of men who have sinned<br>
For so long I've sat frozen, forgotten by the rest of my kin<br>
This fate forced upon me<br>
Breeds hatred toward myself<br>
How can one enjoy their place when you feel only pain?<br>
How can a father feel no shame treating his son like a slave?<br>
<br>
Oh father please come down to me,<br>
I haven't seen your face in what seems like eternity<br>
I have chosen to let go of my resentment I feel for you<br>
Let me retake my place at your side<br>
To be a lesson to the rest of your pride<br>
You fool, you fell<br>
Now forever you'll be trapped in hell<br>
<br>
How can a God be so blind?<br>
I think you should take this time to repent<br>
You need to realise you aren't worth shit<br>
<br>
Now to alleviate millennia of torment<br>
I will become the swift hand of sorrow<br>
Thrust upon your beloved world of ignorance<br>
Their time left is only time borrowed<br>
Mark these words; I will not show them penitence<br>
Humanity will unite and suffer<br>
<br>
Chained inside your own design<br>
A God left with no one but his mind<br>
Losing himself in torment<br>
You will feel the wrath of Satan</p>

In the beginning of your wretched fucking<br>
ives you were given names to<br>
separate and individualise<br>
Now that the end has finally begun<br>
your mortal world will succumb to a hateful demise<br>
Every human will be stripped<br>
of their guise<br>
Forced beneath to burn in flames<br>
as I wreak havoc on judgment day<br>
Chained together, fused by your bones<br>
A living wall of flesh to eternally cry and moan<br>
A raging sea of tears drip and<br>
fall from wave after wave of the human wall<br>
<br>
There is no god<br>
Only I, Satan himself<br>
My legions of demons will drag you all to hell<br>
There is no death<br>
Only pain, my enslavement of the human race<br>
Just the mere heat of hell fire<br>
will destroy each filthy human face<br>
<br>
You will rot in hell<br>
I, breather of death<br>
The unholy life eater<br>
Will feed upon the children of Christ<br>
<br>
Your fairy tales will be no shield<br>
Your holy book will be no sword<br>
I'll piss in your holy water<br>
Pestilence will overcome everything<br>
Eating and corroding your hearts and minds<br>
I fear no man, finally unbound<br>
Your saviour Christ is nothing but a ghost<br>
And where is he now?<br>
Where the fuck is he now?<br>
<br>
I'll slit my wrists and drink<br>
my blood just to show my immortality<br>
I will devour this world<br>
Your prayers will never defeat me<br>
You hold your hands to the sky<br>
With hopes and pathetic cries<br>

There is no god<br>
Only I, Satan himself<br>
My legions of demons will drag you all to hell<br>
There is no death<br>
Only pain, my enslavement of the human race<br>
Just the mere heat of hell fire<br>
will destroy each filthy human, face<br>
<br>
It's time I drank your blood<br>
Pour it all into my chalice made of flesh<br>
I will become your god<br>
This Elixir Vitae has me blessed<br>
Your soul is mine<br>
You'll burn for the rest of time<br>
All life lives to die and everything<br>
that dies will be mine</p>

Death is looming...<br>
This day I begin my reign as<br>
your hands and feet are bound in chains<br>
To walk single file just like slaves<br>
Numbers forcefully engraved into<br>
foreheads to prepare them for eternal pain<br>
Not a single human will survive<br>
because they follow like sheep with no fucking eyes<br>
As countless bodies fall to empower<br>

Drying and fracturing the skin<br>

Blood spills from every crack and crevasse<br>

With a thirst for human souls and an insatiable<br>

Amidst the turmoil appears a familiar sight<br>
Draped in white robes, a man bearing an almost blinding light<br>
God's "true" heir, the son of the man with no might<br>
Comes before my power to attempt to rectify my blight<br>

Betrayal never goes unpunished<br>
And yours is of the greatest heresy<br>
I rip your heart right from your chest<br>
And now there is empty space where<br>
your face used to be<br>
Excitedly tearing your flesh from bone<br>
Ever so delicately as not to damage my new wardrobe<br>
I merrily dance as I dress myself<br>
in your skin like a taxidermy specimen<br>
<br>
I will return to the highest of heavens<br>

Never to find a way of your own,<br>

automation has overtaken,<br>
the future segregated<br>
with binary information<br>
mankind enslaved by<br>
its most outstanding creation<br>
<br>
Brainwashed<br>
Brain dead<br>
believing all that we see<br>
we are the slaves of technology<br>
<br>
Brainwashed<br>
Brain dead<br>
these thoughts are planted in our heads<br>
this world has become proprietary<br>
<br>
This digital age has infected us all<br>
human minds enslaved by corporations<br>
the entire nation<br>
Isolated<br>
Incubated<br>
Intelligence is about to be obliterated<br>

        <h1 id="s7" class="lyrics-test">-Harvested-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">This earth was abundant with<br>
all we want and need<br>
now left exhausted by those<br>
determined to sustain<br>
an existence consumed by gluttony<br>
stripped to its core, drained of it's life<br>
<br>
exhumed from within, magma mined for profit<br>
debilitated of all forms of energy,<br>
doomed civilization, objurgation<br>
placed on our failures<br>
<br>
no a lifeless sphere floating through space,<br>
this is the end of the human race<br>
<br>
we are the merchants of our own death,<br>
selling our lives like commodities,<br>
no anguish for the consummation<br>
the final product of the homo sapiens<br>
the future is bleak, our own oxygen<br>
executes the populace<br>
raped of its vitality, entirely exhausted<br>
<br>
as our earth slowly becomes a wasteland<br>
the human race will be engulfed by flames,<br>
extinguished by greed,<br>
all life fades away<br>
appetence devours the souls of the weak<br>
<br>
infinite potential, death by finity<br>
hollowing the core of our own planet<br>
<br>
restoring the balance of our universe<br>
we harvested the freedom<br>
that we depended on<br>
now this world will devour our souls<br>
the inexorable ways of our avarice<br>
have driven us to the depths of the abyss<br>
let the visions of annihilation<br>
feed at your mind<br>
<br>
toxicity penetrates our veins,<br>
poisoned from the inside out<br>
gasping for air, our organs<br>
began to decompose<br>
decayed flesh, corroded morality<br>
contaminated existence,<br>
total loss of humanity</p>

        <h1 id="s8" class="lyrics-test">-The Moral Decay-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">disinformation state ordained and<br>
maintained by shadow government<br>
expelling their lies, no care for suffering<br>
disregard for the fate of those they protect<br>
<br>
institutionalized and mechanized for full effect<br>
superior ruling by inferior intelligence,<br>
the weak minded lead easily astray<br>
<br>
the machine can't be stopped<br>
inside our heads halting free thoughts<br>
indoctrinated psychologically persuaded<br>
the media induced hatred can't be evaded<br>
misleading the masses<br>
herding the captives<br>
civic deception designed to consume your life<br>
fail of governance<br>
<br>
infiltrating the consciousness of the feeble willed<br>
animus disguised in the form of false enlightenment,<br>
the narrative, controlled by the upper hierarchy,<br>
they want to see us suffer,<br>
imprisoned by our own minds<br>
<br>
seeking to conceal the truth,<br>
masked by dissemination and<br>
involuntary hallucinations<br>
we are enslaved by the informational discourse<br>
propagating twisted deceit through<br>
publicized declarations<br>
factualness impalpable, the truth is intangible<br>
<br>
the machine can't be stopped<br>
inside our heads halting free thoughts<br>
indoctrinated psychologically persuaded<br>
the media induced hatred can't be evaded<br>
misleading the masses<br>
herding the captives<br>
civic deception designed to consume your life<br>
fail of governance<br>
<br>
living in distortion, dying in the name of fabrication<br>
diminished abilities to construct authentic logic<br>
<br>
infiltrated, segregated, manipulated<br>
eternally betrayed<br>
<br>
isolated from the truth<br>
deprived of liberation<br>
governmental domination</p>

        <h1 id="s9" class="lyrics-test">-Social Serpent-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">slithering social serpent of hell<br>
another innocent prey falls victim to your spell<br>
sadistic, vindictive<br>
your thirst for sorrow grows<br>
misery is the realm in which you dwell<br>
<br>
spineless, mindless, filthy creature of deceit<br>
you wander this earth with false intention<br>
emancipated from reality<br>
obscured perceptions of actuality<br>
bottom feeder, cancer of society<br>
denominator, fucking betrayer<br>
<br>
a hollow excuse for existence<br>
flocking to those that you can drain the life of,<br>
feeder of hatred, glutton of commiseration<br>
<br>
slithering social serpent of hell<br>
another innocent prey falls victim to your spell<br>
sadistic, vindictive<br>
your thirst for sorrow grows<br>
misery is the realm in which you dwell<br>
<br>
I want to see you fucking quiver<br>
<br>
your last breath suffocated,<br>
feel the hands of vengeance<br>
choke around your neck<br>
tremble in my wake, your true destiny awaits<br>
<br>
repugnance for your existence,<br>
animosity turned contagion<br>
malice venom comes creeping through your veins<br>
emotions paralysed as your corpses parades about<br>
blinded from truth,<br>
disassociated from sensibility<br>
<br>
bottom feeder, cancer of society<br>
denominator, fucking betrayer<br>
<br>
dousing the flames of contentment<br>
narcissistic demeanor, self absorbent presence<br>
societal residue,<br>
cold blooded, black hearted<br>
ingenious and delusive<br>
<br>
slithering social serpent of hell<br>
another innocent prey falls victim to your spell<br>
sadistic, vindictive<br>
your thirst for sorrow grows<br>
misery is the realm in which you dwell

        <h1 id="s10" class="lyrics-test">-Death March-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Imprisoned within our own demise, held captive<br>
by our decline, war plagues this earth<br>
as the death toll upheaves<br>
watch the souls of the fallen plunge into the abyss<br>
<br>
gathered in flocks, marched in masses,<br>
slain by the thousands, see the blood drops falling<br>
all hope for man is dead<br>
I begin to quiver as I see death<br>
<br>
gathered in flocks, marched in masses,<br>
slain by the thousands, see the blood drops falling<br>
all hope for man is dead<br>
I begin to quiver as I see death<br>
<br>
all hope is dead, the blood is on our hands<br>
death lingers in the air, the only conflict is within<br>
<br>
life dissolves as every drop of blood hits the dirt,<br>
once pure soil is now plasma stained mud<br>
hallucinations of salvation daunt my mind<br>
lights dim, sorrow swells, life is lost<br>
<br>
I watched the eyes of my fellow man roll back<br>
into his head, death in unison,<br>
the so called human condition<br>
we will be enslaved by our own mistakes<br>
<br>
united we failed, divided we die<br>
a sense of looming death clouds the sky<br>
the final solution is here and visions of our<br>
once great lives now fill my head<br>
massacre is all that we are designed to know<br>
the fall of humanity is here,<br>
<br>
because we're gathered in flocks, marched in masses,<br>
slain by the thousands, see the blood drops falling<br>
all hope for man is dead<br>
I begin to quiver as I see death<br>
<br>
gathered in flocks, marched in masses,<br>
slain by the thousands, see the blood drops falling<br>
all hope for man is dead<br>
I begin to quiver as I see death<br>
<br>
all hope is dead, the blood is on our hands<br>
death lingers in the air, the only conflict is within<br>
<br>
remnants of failure linger about,<br>
a life in the realm of desolation is bleak<br>
eyes begin to ice over<br>
as the final breath of life is exhaled</p>
