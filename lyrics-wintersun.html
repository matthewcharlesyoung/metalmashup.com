      <p class="lyrics-test-test">...For years I have traveled in coldness,<br>
But my heart is warm as the darkened sun above me...<br>
Nothing can never take away<br>
What I've seen with these tired eyes<br>
<br>
Face of the weeping night<br>
And the shade of the fading light<br>
<br>
The dawn will never rise again for my eyes<br>
And I will never sleep again<br>
I've lost my hope time after time<br>
'Cause the light has vanished from the sky<br>
<br>
Now when the darkness has become part of me<br>
I got to let my shadows free<br>
'Cause I never looked behind, I never tried to find<br>
Something that could have made me one<br>
Now when the sorrow has taken control of me<br>
I got to let my shadows free<br>
'Cause I never looked behind, I never tried to find<br>
Something that could have made me one<br>
Something that I could reach the Sun</p>

      <h1 id="f2" class="lyrics-test">-Winter Madness-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">Divine creations now<br>
destroyed to uncover the haunted atmosphere<br>
Strange visions of the ancient spirits, travesty of man appears<br>
Coldness and the storming winds lurking for prey<br>
The forces of the Winter reign in dreadful way,<br>
there's no escape<br>
<br>
I'm following the mistress of night<br>
Through the gates of snow we'll fly<br>
We'll fly<br>
<br>
Winter - The realm of eternal ice<br>
Snowfall and darkness descends upon the vales of time<br>
Distant caress of the sun's fading light<br>
The lands were painted white with the Winter's might<br>
<br>
My hands are frozen,<br>
my mind is at the edge of madness<br>
Oh how many nights and days,<br>
I've been lost in this land of sadness<br>
<br>
From the primitive thoughts, under the glimmering snow<br>
And burning stones - they'll rise -<br>
The artful spirit: "You don't have to die,<br>
You can rule in afterlife, just concede your soul to me,<br>
(your life is cheap) - no price -"</p>

      <h1 id="f3" class="lyrics-test">-Sleeping Stars-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">Oh sleeping stars, why are you so sad tonight<br>
Oh sleeping stars, will you shine for me tonight<br>
Oh sleeping stars<br>
<br>
Can you see them float in the night sky<br>
Can you hear those echoes of their sweet cries, creating a tune<br>
Can you see them shine so bright<br>
Can you feel their loneliness<br>
through their cold light, touching you<br>
<br>
My eyes feel so heavy when the stars are calling me<br>
- Join with us eternally -<br>
I'm falling in deep trance and my powers are weakening<br>
I'm falling in a world between dreams and reality<br>
<br>
I am now alone in the silent light<br>
And there's nothing but darkness around me<br>
Deeper into unknown the strange light is guiding me<br>
Wake me until it's too late<br>
<br>
Suddenly I feel a warmth go through my body<br>
But I feel that a part of me has died,<br>
I sense the change in me<br>
I must have been away so long<br>
So please stay with me for a while</p>

      <h1 id="f4" class="lyrics-test">-Battle Against Time-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">... I'm sailing away to undiscovered seas...<br>
<br>
I see a golden light shining far away<br>
I can't tell if I'll make it there someday<br>
I reach my hands but there's no one on my path<br>
I can't sleep 'cause my body is burning<br>
Cold sweat, cannot breath, I'm loosing my mind<br>
Reflection in the mirror shows a different man at night<br>
And as hours and seconds pass by<br>
I feel my every feeling wither and die<br>
Do I really feel this pain<br>
'cause sometimes I can't tell if I'm awake<br>
<br>
Watching to the night, the hope is gone<br>
Carrying so much burden in my heart<br>
Watching to the night with tired eyes<br>
Waiting for nothing all my life<br>
<br>
Battle against time<br>
I... battle against time<br>
<br>
I am covered with cold ice, I am flying in the black skies<br>
Fighting everyday, but it feels like, it's just the same<br>
Oh time... you cut my heart and soul<br>
You carve my will and passion of life<br>
'cause the days of emptiness are piercing through me like arrows<br>
<br>
I feel nothing, but hate and love<br>
So much fire inside, so much left undone<br>
Hate&Love<br>
<br>
... I'm sailing away and nothing will ever be the same...</p>

      <h1 id="f5" class="lyrics-test">-Death And The Healing-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">A windstorm dropped a bird from the sky<br>
It fell to the ground and it's wings broke and died<br>
But when the time got by, back to sky it flied<br>
'cause the wings healed in time and the bird was I<br>
<br>
Time is the death and the healing<br>
Take your last breath, 'cause death is deceiving<br>
Time is the past, now and tomorrow<br>
Days fly so fast and it leaves me so hollow<br>
<br>
A snowstorm blew inside a wolf's eyes<br>
And the frozen tears covered all the mountainsides<br>
But then the time got by and the wolf died<br>
And someday that wolf would be I</p>

      <h1 id="f6" class="lyrics-test">-Starchild-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">[Part I (Wanderer of Time)]<br>
<br>
So mysterious is your world,<br>
Concealed beyond the stars<br>
Far away from the earth,<br>
It flows one with time and dark as the night<br>
Million shapes and colours<br>
Are storming inside your mind<br>
Creating endless dimensions<br>
Forming universes without walls<br>
<br>
Let go! of the stars, the stars that fell into the sea<br>
Let go! of your thoughts and dreams,<br>
What can you see now<br>
<br>
You cannot save them anymore<br>
- Wanderer of time -<br>
It's too late now<br>
- Creator of Dimensions -<br>
Destroy the walls of time<br>
Hands of the blind are holding your fate<br>
Tides of life will take you away, will take you away<br>
<br>
Starchild!<br>
Visions are born from the unknown force<br>
It dominates the way of time<br>
The dream only ends, when the worlds come to an end<br>
Starchild!<br>
You cannot escape to the dark streams of the sea,<br>
To suppress your dreams<br>
Nothing can keep you away from the need to create<br>
'cause your path is free...<br>
<br>
[Part II (Burning Star)]<br>
<br>
I've hold the fire within myself<br>
Years I've walked in the coldest winds<br>
Through the deserts of sand and snow<br>
The time is passing and I know;<br>
That I'm wasting my life, destroying my dreams<br>
I'm diving into the bottomless sea<br>
From sorrow and pain I find my strength<br>
The more pain I feel, the more I see<br>
Now I'm watching my life flowing in the dark<br>
Like streams of fear running through my heart<br>
And it's wearing me down until I'm gone<br>
Soon I'll join the endless whirls of stars<br>
And I fall (something is dying, yet something is born)<br>
deeper into the unknown voids<br>
And I fall (when will I find my silent dawn)<br>
into infinity like a burning star<br>
I fall like a burning star!<br>
<br>
[Part III (The Creation)]<br>
<br>
The curtains of mist are fading<br>
And the veils of star clouds are revealed<br>
Storms of new energy<br>
Flows in the depths of my mind<br>
New constellations are born<br>
In total harmony of perfection<br>
And the dissonant unbalance was broken<br>
As the colours fell straight from the light<br>
<br>
[Part IV (The Sea of Stars)]<br>
<br>
I'm floating in the sea of stars,<br>
I'm drifting away from the shore<br>
I will be lost in the dream when the dark days come<br>
But I will make the time run backwards and<br>
I'll make the stars shine again<br>
I will light up the sky to a bright crimson nights<br>
... And they'll shine together forever<br>
With brilliant silver colours they'll shine forever<br>
<br>
[Part V (Finale)]<br>
<br>
The whirls of stars takes you now far away<br>
Away from the cold nightmare<br>
Let go of you thoughts and dreams<br>
And you will feel the warmth once again<br>
Starchild! in the Sea of Stars you fall<br>
You fall like a burning star!<br>
Starchild! in the Sea of Stars you fall<br>
... But there is no end to creation</p>

      <h1 id="f7" class="lyrics-test">-Beautiful Death-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">My face turned pale before<br>
the cold eyes of death<br>
My body was frozen by the stare from the dark<br>
I don't want to think of anything,<br>
but there's storm of thoughts in my head<br>
I wasn't prepared for this, 'cause I'm not ready to die<br>
Nothing could have prepared me for this<br>
[backwards:] Only way out is through window of dreams<br>
<br>
Nothing but blood so red and deceased<br>
Nothing but pain, I fall on my knees<br>
Tormenting demons, I suffer and bleed<br>
Only way out is through window of dreams<br>
<br>
The rain whips the lonely and crushed soul<br>
The dark clouds are closing fast,<br>
the wind is blowing the colours of life away<br>
The growing shadow will darken my dreams,<br>
and with the fire inside me it feeds<br>
I'll be screaming in the stars when it's over<br>
Storms are raging on the path to home,<br>
once so silent and calm<br>
The desperate glare of the dark<br>
light is cast on the fallen one<br>
And when the illusions sigh no more,<br>
the journey to new dream will carry on<br>
'Cause life is just a beautiful death<br>
<br>
Life turns a new and strange page<br>
They will try to take everything away from me<br>
You'll never know the future<br>
Save me from the rain<br>
Tell me what matters in life, if anything<br>
I'm struggling with sickness<br>
They will try to take everything away from me<br>
Are you trying to hide from the end<br>
Save me from the rain<br>
Save me from the end<br>
<br>
'Cause life will always be withering away from us<br>
I want to be alone with you<br>
And I'll give my heart to you, before I go<br>
'Cause life is just a beautiful, beautiful death</p>

      <h1 id="f8" class="lyrics-test">-Sadness And Hate-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">Sad night, the weeper of starwind sky<br>
Take me where the shimmering lights are fading out<br>
Through the shadows of hate and through the fires of grace<br>
I followed the voice in the night,<br>
beautiful as black sky,<br>
But nothing I found<br>
<br>
My thoughts are captured by the magical chants<br>
Of the spirits, but I cannot see them with these dead eyes<br>
Lost I am in these dismal streams<br>
Lost I am forever in my life<br>
<br>
The snow is falling on the withering leaves,<br>
I am left in the cold<br>
The shadows are crying in the moonlight<br>
Is this night the last of my life<br>
<br>
Have we arrived from our journey,<br>
I must ask you now<br>
At last I can cry,<br>
'cause these sad words are calling me tonight<br>
My eyes bleed for you my star,<br>
my pride and the love of my heart<br>
But why did you had to fly so far,<br>
I raged and it tore me apart<br>
I promise to you with sadness and hate<br>
Wherever I might go, you will know...<br>
<br>
I give my life to the withering leaves<br>
To the bleeding moonlight<br>
To the crying shadows<br>
I GIVE MY LIFE TO YOU</p>

        <p class="lyrics-test-test">[I Rain Of Stars]<br>
<br>
Behold the rain of stars - The awakening of darkened skies<br>
Falling from the dark - The symphony of dying lights<br>
Behold the rain of stars - The blazing fire came pouring down<br>
Falling from the dark - And life and death became unbound<br>
Sons of winter and stars - Rise!<br>
Sons of winter and stars - Rise!<br>
Sons of winter and stars! Rise! Rise!<br>
Fly with us through the darkness<br>
Sons of winter and stars! Rise! Rise!<br>
And we shall embrace the stars<br>
And we shall open the doors of time<br>
<br>
[II Surrounded By Darkness]<br>
<br>
I have awaken the darkness<br>
Taste the fear! Taste the pain!<br>
I am the one who seeks vengeance<br>
Into the darkness we fly<br>
Into the shadows they hide<br>
Into the darkness we fly<br>
They will never survive, they ́ll die<br>
Oh they will die!<br>
I sacrifice everything, just for one moment<br>
I throw away everything that matters to me the most<br>
I ́m flying through the darkness<br>
The fire casts a shadow on me<br>
I tear a part of my heart for creation of dimensions<br>
And we fly beyond the restless shadows<br>
We fly beyond the stars<br>
We fly beyond the birth of the worlds<br>
So old I ́ve become - Thousand years staring into emptiness<br>
But now I realize - That it was just an illusion<br>
All this time I thought it was you that would save the sun<br>
Oh rain comes and washes the hate away<br>
Now I am at the crossroads with questions<br>
Somewhere, someday I will find what I am here for<br>
Who am I<br>
<br>
[III Journey Inside A Dream]<br>
<br>
I ́m wondering now where will you take me<br>
From the horizon the light comes alive<br>
Into the mountains high we set our way<br>
Will we find our way in this long winter night<br>
I see the land of fading sun and rising mountains<br>
And I finally feel that I ́ve found my home<br>
But oh, how it feels so cold when<br>
my dreams wither in fragments of time<br>
Revealing that this land will die<br>
Before the winds so cold<br>
The world was shattered in the fragments of time<br>
Before the autumn rains<br>
The coldness will again awake<br>
Falling snow, so soft and cold<br>
Dying moon cast down so weak<br>
Frozen lake, the dancing spirits<br>
Calling me to join in the cosmic dream<br>
The silence is tempting me now...<br>
<br>
[IV Sons Of Winter And Stars]<br>
<br>
We are the Sons of Winter and Stars<br>
We ́ve come from a far beyond time<br>
Forever the fire burns in our hearts<br>
Our world shall never die<br>
In the arms of the wind we ride till dawn<br>
As the waves of the ocean grind so strong<br>
We wander in the stars until we ́re gone<br>
Our fate is sealed by eternal sun<br>
Until we fade away - Fate will find it ́s way<br>
Until we drift into the dark<br>
It ́s not too late to find a way - Fate will find it ́s way<br>
And fly in cold embrace of stars<br>
Mysteries of time<br>
Unfolding in cosmic dreams<br>
Leaving life and death meaningless<br>
Before the revelation of infinity<br>
Embrace the stars!<br>
The energy flows in me like a river of stars<br>
I ́m surrounded by the circle of fire,<br>
but eternal ice has frozen my heart<br>
I ́m lost in the pathways of time<br>
But now the time has come for us!<br>
We are the Sons of Winter and Stars!

Time has made the frozen tears fall like rain from the starlit sky<br>
And I feel so cold, I can ́t make it tomorrow<br>
Oh, but the night will see where this path will lead my life<br>
Endless field of snow at the edge of the world and the wailing<br>
Winds so cold scar my face, I ́m going insane<br>
I am lost from the light - And the memories follow me in the night<br>
I ́m left in the arms of winter and I am carried far away - Far away<br>
Night is falling over my home<br>
<br>
The land of snow and sorrow, oh carry me away from the cold<br>
And I fall asleep, I will dream the last dream<br>
All I was, is gone now and sorrow is all I feel<br>
And the white snow is falling from the starlit sky<br>
And the stars are shining like your eyes<br>
You are so beautiful<br>
<br>
And I will follow them in this cold winter night<br>
So I ́d find my way to you this time<br>
Drifting away from the warmth of the darkness<br>
Caressed by the light of a million stars<br>
The darkness will always be a part of my heart<br>
Until I ́m carried away by the winter ́s arms<br>
Night is falling over my home<br>

Sleep now for a while before the storm awakes<br>
And one day it will reward you for the burden of wait<br>
The roots go deep into the frozen dead ground<br>
Listen to the land of snow, it makes no sound<br>
For ages searching the warmth of the sun<br>
If it never finds me, I can die as one<br>
Time will go on and we are drifting away in the night<br>
I ́ve been searching so long,<br>

But tonight I feel so<br>
alone and I know that you are forever gone<br>

It feels like my life is ending<br>
Oh, another year gone by<br>
But nothing has changed in my life<br>
And time goes on forever and ever<br>
And it waits for no one<br>

Time fades away<br>
And I fade away<br>
And I ́ll never be the same<br>

<br>
Beneath the murky soil<br>
The draw of the ancient spell<br>
Swallowing everything in the ground<br>
And then there was no sound<br>
<br>
Twisting the roots of life<br>
Distorting the obscure shapes<br>
The day was creeping into night<br>
And then there was no light<br>
<br>
The mist was rolling from the mountains<br>
Creatures were crawling under the ground<br>
The darkness fell from the sky<br>
And then there was no life<br>
<br>
The spell was too strong<br>
Too weak to resist its pull<br>
The wind was frozen still as I took my last breath<br>
But then there was no death<br>
<br>
The days turned into years<br>
The years turned into eternity<br>
The natural order was twisted into dark harmony<br>
Dark dark harmony<br>
<br>
I created my own fears<br>
The mist of sorrow encircled my thoughts<br>
The demons came forth from the shadows bringing dark disease<br>
Dark dark disease<br>
<br>
With a sudden roar the ground trembled and cried<br>
As the fire burned a hole in the sky<br>
The light was swallowed into the ground<br>
and the colors were broken in the night<br>
And all the stars' creations were left to die<br>
<br>
Now! Let the dark disease wipe out all the living<br>
Oh! And let all the lands be filled with silence<br>
In the night´s cold embrace you left me astray<br>
And the hope of new life fades away<br>
Now! Let all the lands be covered in black snow<br>
Will the morning sun ever rise again<br>
And let all the creatures of the forest turn into stone<br>
The slow demise has begun<br>
Will this be forever<br>

From the shadows of old we rise<br>
Awaken from the dark - from the dark slumber<br>

Over the ancient ruins we fly<br>
Where the old kings go to die<br>
And new kingdoms rising high<br>
Awaken from the dark dark slumber<br>
<br>
Awaken from the dark - from the dark slumber<br>
Awaken from the dark dark slumber<br>
<br>
Rise!<br>
<br>
Creatures of the dawn<br>
Crawling from the depths of the frozen earth<br>
As the shadows were twisting and turning beneath the sun<br>
<br>
The sound of the moaning beasts<br>
Blaring through the forest<br>
As they´re roaming wild beneath the morning sun<br>
<br>
Ride! Ride with us again!<br>
Fight! And live as free men!<br>
Die! And be born again!<br>

Fight! Fight!<br>
And live as free men!<br>
Die! Die!<br>

Die and be born again!<br>
<br>
Centuries in darkness<br>
Bound to ruthless ice and snow<br>
As the dawn of the new world rises, we shall be free<br>
<br>
By the fire we live and die<br>
And the light of the sun fills our eyes<br>
From the fire beyond the ancient stars we are born<br>
<br>
From the realms below we ride<br>
And in terror they run and hide<br>
From the shadows of old we rise<br>
Awaken from the dark - from the dark slumber<br>

Over the ancient ruins we fly<br>
Where the old kings go to die<br>
And new kingdoms rising high<br>
Awaken from the dark dark slumber<br>

A sad song of winter and the howling wind<br>
Visions of the past in the haunting dreams<br>
Under the dead sky, under the withered trees<br>
<br>
The night falls upon the forest that weeps<br>
Father of shadows that forever sleeps
</p>

          <h1 id="t3" class="lyrics-test">-Eternal Darkness (Autumn)-</h1>
          <p class="lyrics-test-test">[Part I Haunting Darkness]<br>
<br>
Haunting darkness forming inside of man<br>
Calling to return the blood of the earth<br>
Baleful shadows gathering under the blackened sky<br>
Reversing the evolution of the forbidden birth<br>
<br>
Devastation of the hollow universe<br>
Executed by wrath and absolute power<br>
Completion of the perfect chaos<br>
The pure destruction of stars<br>
<br>
I am the immortal shadow<br>
The ruler of dark dimensions<br>
Behold my crimson nightmare<br>
I am the creator of sorrow<br>
Tormentor in the restless night<br>
I am the hunter of fear, the bringer of despair<br>
I am death<br>
I am eternal darkness<br>
<br>
[Part II The Call of the Dark Dream]<br>
<br>
Unleash the dark dream, the essence of deception<br>
The fantasy of life will blind you like the flaming sun<br>
The clash of the opposite worlds<br>
The cosmic war of the unnatural state has begun<br>
<br>
Embrace the suffering and prepare for transcendent attack<br>
Obliterate the memories and smother the past<br>
And face the unknown! And face the unknown!<br>
<br>
Hear the call of the final journey<br>
Hear the call!<br>
Hear the call of the dark dream<br>
Calling from across the stars of old<br>
Hear the call!<br>
Hear the call of the dark dream<br>
<br>
[Part III Beyond the Infinite Universe]<br>
<br>
Wandering among the stars... Searching...<br>
Beyond the infinite universe...<br>
Tearing down the structures...<br>
But I can only see darkness...<br>
<br>
Caressed by the radiant ocean<br>
Soaring high in the waves of sadness<br>
Obsessed by the deepest emotions<br>
Lost in the beautiful silence<br>
Oh the beautiful silence!<br>
<br>
Fall!<br>
Falling through the layers of mind<br>
Fall!<br>
As the world is crumbling before my eyes<br>
Falling through the caustic vortex<br>
And my heart is burning by the ultimate lie<br>
The ultimate lie!<br>
<br>
[Part IV Death]<br>
<br>
There is no end<br>
There is no beginning<br>
There is no truth<br>
There is only darkness<br>
<br>
And I curse you into oblivion!<br>
<br>
I curse you for fulfilling your every desire<br>
I curse you for your wild and relentless inner fire<br>
Curse you for your need to breed and multiply<br>
Curse you for your consciousness<br>
The feeble rebellion<br>
The great illusion<br>
The cosmic war<br>
<br>
I am the immortal shadow<br>
The ruler of dark dimensions<br>
Behold my crimson nightmare<br>
I am the creator of sorrow<br>
Tormentor in the restless night<br>
I am the hunter of pain, the bringer of rain<br>
I am death<br>
I am eternal darkness<br>
<br>
I am eternal<br>
I am death

          <h1 id="t4" class="lyrics-test">-Loneliness (Winter)-</h1>
          <p class="lyrics-test-test">Once I saw the light in your eyes<br>
But nothing will be any longer the way I remember<br>
I've become someone else and I can't go back, I tried<br>
I'm lost in the fields of snow far from home<br>
<br>
Follow the coast under the frozen sky<br>
With a growing sorrow in weary eyes<br>
Swallow the ghost of the lucid dream<br>
And silent will be the mournful sea<br>
<br>
The sands of life covered in white<br>
From the darkest nights to the blinding light<br>
I almost reached home, I was so close<br>
But to be left alone is what hurts the most<br>
<br>
Am I the only one awake<br>
Am I the one who is fading away<br>
There was so much I wanted to say<br>
Do I have a reason anymore to stay<br>
<br>
Washed away by the morning sun<br>
Hear the howling call from the other side<br>
And so much was left undone<br>
The weight of the world quietly crushed the dying light<br>
Washed away by the frozen stars<br>
Feel the burning coldness of the falling snow<br>
And one day when everything is gone<br>
The trail in the snow disappears, am I finally home
