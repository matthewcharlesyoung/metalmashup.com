Witness my hate grow stronger with every passing day<br>
The path of total destruction is here.<br>
I can hear the serpents constrict the veins of the weak.<br>
Their lungs will collapse, their bones will break.<br>
The beast inside will reign down.<br><br>
No one will be saved<br>
The pungent stench of my catacombs linger in the air.<br>
My vaults of death exposed, to strike fear in the eyes of the cowards.<br>
Hypocrisy is granted to the most violent of kings.<br>
No crown to gain, no throne to uphold<br><br>
Your life is the only possession obtained<br>
I bring forth the true vision of agony.<br>
Marked for treason, forever staining your flesh<br>

Bow at their feet and succumb to their every demand.<br>
I must put an end to this wretched monarchy.<br>
I bring forth a vicious path.<br>
The spawn of agony.<br>
I shall carve my name between their eyes.<br>
Marked and left for dead.<br>
Beneath the blackened skies<br>
I can hear their cries.<br>
Marked and left for dead<br><br>

So let the cowards run for the fucking hills.<br>
I will scatter their bones within the sky<br>
As a monument for the whole world to see<br><br>

The pack grows hungry<br>
For the taste of their blood spill<br>
As daylight turns to dusk and time stands still<br><br>

So let the wolves feed upon the young<br>
They ravage the corpses of those cast from the Earth<br><br>

The pack grows hungry<br>
For the taste of their blood spill<br>
As daylight turns to dusk and time stands still<br><br>

I shall carve my name between their eyes<br>
Marked and left for dead<br>
Beneath the blackened skies<br>
I can hear their cries<br>
Marked and left for dead<br>
I shall carve my name<br>
Marked and left for dead<br>

Reduced to this earth for eternity.<br>
Sleepless winter nights still walking cold streets,<br>
Searching with wondering eyes.<br>
I can see you from the shadows,<br><br>
I wait, I hide.<br>
Walking fast your heart skips<br>
beats as tears fall from your face.<br>
You feel death in the air as I begin to take chase,<br>
Hatred is unleashed full force<br>
upon that beautiful face.<br>
Can you feel my hatred?<br>
It's hard to see with your eyes removed.<br><br>
Now I'm seeking vengeance,<br>
For every word was a bitter lie.<br><br>
The time has come to show you passion,<br>
As I send your loved ones to their grave.<br>
I will drown you in their blood.<br>
Their bodies left for flies.<br>
I will fill these hand-made caskets.<br><br>
Dismembered limbs, collected eyes,<br>

Your wretched corpse bloated and half decayed.<br>
The smell of rotting entrails still lingers in my mind.<br>
You were a work of art<br>
A thing of beauty.<br><br>
I pushed your body back out to sea.<br>
Never to be seen again.<br>
You left me wandering the shorelines,<br>
Begging for your return.<br>
But you never returned.<br>
I drag their bodies to the sand and earth<br>

You were inspiration in it's purest form.<br>

Spawned with the darkest intentions.<br>
We spill the blood of man.<br>
Feeding this machine.<br>
As the parasites thrive within the blood of all humanity.<br><br>
Feeding upon the cells of man.<br>
Gorging themselves on our blood.<br>
Inside this human hive.<br>
They have embedded themselves inside our nervous system.<br>
We are a host to an evil creation.<br>
They riddle our bodies with hatred,<br>
Turning us on each other.<br>
Convulsions begin as they consume our internal design.<br><br>
Forging their creation inside our mind.<br>
Implanted in false memories.<br>
We are the generation of the damned.<br>

Their jaws unhinge as they froth at the mouth with hunger.<br>
Our hearts pounding with fear as the trumpets sound<br>
their ascension.<br>
Birthing a plague of devastation.<br><br>
A plan for bloodshed devised beneath our very soil.<br>
The serpents shed their rotting skin and swarm the<br>
cracks of the earth.<br>
In his presence they cower as he arises from his throne.<br>
His gruesome slaughter unleashed upon the world.<br><br>
Watch as the vultures circle.<br>
Watch as the maggots feast upon this human wasteland.<br>
The devour the flesh and blood of man with<br>

I hear the screams of the aborted daughters.<br><br>
As the conquering begins of the kings,<br>
And their rising sons.<br>
They slaughter the strange and pillage the weak.<br>
They stand tall at your defeat.<br>
I gaze at the atmospheric effects induced to the earth.<br>
Reduced to nothing,<br><br>
The thrones of misery now bear the weight of their morality.<br>
The dead will bring us new life.<br>
The past forgotten - buried in the dirt.<br>
This fucking world will suffer.<br>
Black out the sun.<br>
Cast the shadows upon their flesh.<br>

I know the end is near<br>
And I do not give a fuck<br>
So look me in the eyes<br>
I know you don't have the guts<br><br>

You probably couldn’t fucking understand<br>
If you’ve been treated like shit then you will comprehend<br>
I’ll fuck sluts until the bitter end<br>

And now she’s the one I choose to point the blame<br>
So believe me when I said I tried<br>
There was something evil, dark inside<br>
Full of hate, hypocrisy<br>
Hand me the blade lets watch her bleed<br><br>
The truth is I won in the end ‘cause I’ve now fucked all of your best friends<br>
So many sleepless nights wishing you were dead<br>
So many visions of you in my head<br>
I just keep wishing you were fucking dead<br>
Breathe – just breath<br><br>

What the fuck was I thinking?<br>
Man, I should’ve known never to trust a cunt<br>
But as men we grow and learn from our past mistakes<br>
The grass is long now but I can still see the snakes<br>
Now the tables have turned and now I know none of that shit was my fault<br><br>

Falling forever with the earth<br><br>
And as I watch the sun fall I fell you by my side<br>
With these scars upon my face, I will remember you<br>
Through our suffering, we've gained strength<br>
As I watch the sun fall I feel you by my side<br><br>
With these scars upon my face, I will remember you<br>
I will remember you with pride</p>
