Oh when the sun comes up you will realize that you were wrong,<br>

And taken over, taken over everything we had.<br>

Oh it's a shame,<br>
You just walked away,<br>
Take everything, I don't want the memories to stay.<br>
Say you didn't see it coming,<br>
But I can see it from a mile away.<br>
Look in between the lines and read the story written on your face.<br>

Oh when the sun comes up you will realize that you were wrong,<br>

Letting go is easier when you have nothing left to lose,<br>
So I'm letting go, I'm letting go, I'm letting go of you.<br>

Oh please, look in me in the eye, next time you stab me in the back.<br>
Oh please, look in me in the eye, next time you stab me in the back.<br>

Oh please, look in me in the eye,<br>

Next time you stab, you stab me, you stab me in the back.<br>

You gave up the second you looked away.<br>

Ignorance had me by the throat<br>
From the day I learned how to sing<br>
But now my eyes are open wide<br>
And this is what I see<br>
<br>
I see the greed in their eyes<br>
They had me fooled at first because I believed all the lies<br>
Oh the lies<br>
I see the greed in their eyes<br>
They had us fooled at first but we're taking control this time<br>
We're taking control this time<br>
<br>
Where were you when they had no faith in us? (where were you?)<br>
Where were you when they shut us out?<br>
It's funny you show up now<br>
And if it fell apart<br>
I know that you'd be nowhere to be found<br>
We did this on our own<br>
Thanks for nothing<br>
<br>
So count your money and I'll count my friends<br>
We'll see who's richer in the end<br>
We'll see who's richer in the end<br>
We'll see who's richer in the end!</p>

I gave you all my heart just to watch it get thrown away<br>
Thrown away<br>
It takes a toll on my soul<br>
'Cause I'm starting to believe that love's just a game we play<br>
Is it all just a game?<br>
<br>
One day I'll heal but I'll be covered in scars<br>
And I'll never forget watching it all fall apart<br>
When you finally came clean about the lies and the games that you played from the start<br>
It's like every second we spent together is always on repeat in the back of my mind<br>
What was I thinking when I gave you my life?<br>
You knew it would end<br>
You knew this would die<br>

You'll never find another one like me<br>

I think I'd give you another chance if you deserved one<br>
I think I'd have room in my heart but I simply reserved none<br>
I'd let you beg on your knees for forgiveness at last<br>
But you're just a mistake<br>
Please give me my life back<br>

You made me so insecure and unsure of everything I thought was real<br>
I just wish I could rewind and go back to a time<br>
When I knew what it was like to feel<br>
I hope someday someone ruins you the way you ruined me<br>
I just want you to know how it feels<br>
I want you to see it's like my heart was made to be broken<br>

Why can't I let go?<br>
Now that it's over I just need you to know<br>

I think I'd give you another chance if you deserved one<br>
I think I'd have room in my heart but I simply reserved none<br>
I'd let you beg on your knees for forgiveness at last<br>

Please give me my life<br>
Give me my life back<br>
<br>
They say it's better to have loved than never at all<br>
But I can't seem to find any good in being thrown at the wall<br>
I'm not sure if I can stand up from this fall<br>
I lay tossing and turning and trying to forget<br>
I thought I'd be over you by now<br>
With all you put me through I'm full of regret<br>
I wish I could just forget somehow<br>
<br>
You'll never find another one like me, yeah<br>
<br>
I think I'd give you another chance if you deserved one<br>
I think I'd have room in my heart but I simply reserved none<br>
I'd let you beg on your knees for forgiveness at last<br>

So when everything is wrong at least I still feel right<br>

The truth is I've just fed myself a lie for too long (for too long)<br>
I never thought this would be me<br>

But now I'm on the verge of self-destruction<br>
How could this happen to me?<br>
I've never been the type to run from anything, run from anything<br>

So sick and tired of wondering where my morals have gone<br>
My father didn't raise me to become this<br>
Where did I go wrong?<br>

There is not much left of me<br>
I can't feel the ground beneath my feet<br>
There is not much left of me<br>

I need your love to erase this doubt<br>
I need your hand to pull me out<br>

Sometimes I feel like I will never learn<br>
'Cause the bottle's always there when I have nowhere else to turn<br>
Will I ever learn?<br>
Will I ever learn?<br>
<br>
I take another sip<br>
The dark room that I'm in becomes dimly lit<br>
This can't be all there is<br>
<br>
And I've been thinking this could be the end of me<br>
Who is this person in the mirror I see?<br>
And I have come so far, thought I was so strong<br>
The truth is I've just fed myself a lie for too long (for too long)<br>
And the only one to blame is me<br>

Who have I become?<br>

I pack my bags and say goodbye to my wife<br>
For what seems like the millionth time<br>
They said it gets easier, but they lied<br>
She looks at me and says, "Really baby, I will be just fine."<br>
But then she looks away so I don't have to see her cry<br>
And that is when I ask myself:<br>
<br>
How am I supposed to be<br>
Everything they expect me to be<br>
When I feel so alone<br>
'Cause I left my heart at home<br>
She needs me, but I know they need me too<br>
So God, give me the strength to do what you created me to do<br>
<br>
Really I'm so thankful for the people I meet<br>
The places I've been and the things I've seen<br>
But when she's not here it doesn't feel like I'm living my dream<br>
I know they say that no one is perfect<br>
But I swear she's perfect for me<br>
And that makes it so much harder to leave<br>
<br>
How am I supposed to be<br>
Everything they expect me to be<br>
When I feel so alone<br>
'Cause I left my heart at home<br>
She needs me, but I know they need me too<br>
So God, give me the strength to do what you created me to do<br>
<br>
If you miss me, I'm just a phone call away<br>
Please be strong, be strong for me<br>
I need you to show me how to change the inside of me<br>
For my heart, for their sake<br>
Be strong, be strong for me<br>

Wake me up, wake me up<br>
I can't remember when enough was enough<br>
I used to be so in love<br>
With this life I lived before it was corrupt<br>
<br>
Take me back to the me that wanted this more than anything<br>
The me that said I would give up everything<br>
Just to live one night in the life, I'm questioning<br>
<br>
Where is the inspiration I need?<br>
How could I hate this?<br>
I used to crave this<br>
I tell my stories as a form of release<br>
I need them just as much as they need me<br>

I always said I'd never waste a single second of this (second of this)<br>
But sometimes I find myself slipping through the cracks<br>
How could I be such a hypocrite?<br>

I think about it all so far, what we've been through<br>
Who we were, who we are<br>
These days the weight of the world is on my shoulders<br>
I never thought it would be this hard<br>
<br>
They come to me to show them who they're supposed to be<br>
I don't wanna let them down<br>
Lord give me the answers they seek<br>
The strength to give to the weak<br>
Give me the desire to plant the seed<br>
This is so much bigger than me<br>
I think I'm in over my head<br>
<br>
Jet-lagged and restless and always beat down<br>
The rooms are full but I'm always alone<br>
This load is too much to carry on my own<br>

I always said I'd never waste a single second of this (second of this)<br>
But sometimes I find myself slipping through the cracks<br>
How could I be such a hypocrite?<br>
We hold their hearts in the palms of our hands<br>
I don't wanna take it for granted<br>
I don't wanna waste the gift that I've been handed<br>

I dig deep for what I know I need<br>
To keep pushing forward, to keep moving<br>
But they expect so much from me<br>
I'm just a person, a human being<br>
<br>
I feel dead inside<br>
So burnt out from all I've seen<br>
Maybe I've gone blind<br>
From always being in the spotlight<br>

I always said I'd never waste a single second of this<br>
But sometimes I find myself slipping through the cracks<br>
How could I be such a hypocrite?<br>

I don't wanna take it for granted<br>

Save me from myself I don't want to hate who I've become<br>
Inhale, exhale<br>
Why is it so hard to breathe<br>
Inhale exhale<br>
Why isn't this working?!<br>
If I live to see the other side of this<br>
I swear I'll never take for granted any happiness<br>
I never knew what i had until it was gone<br>
How long will this go on?<br>
<br>
Why am I terrified of everything I used to love<br>
Save me from myself I don't want to hate who I've become<br>
Tell me that tomorrow when I wake up I'll be fine<br>
I just want to be myself again<br>
I want to know that I'm alive<br>
<br>
Tell me is there something that I'm learning from this?<br>
I try my best to make the most of it<br>
Maybe i just need to see the bigger picture<br>
Show me how it ends<br>
<br>
If I have to feel this forever,<br>
I'd rather feel nothing at all.<br>
<br>
[Spoken:]<br>
Bring me back to life<br>
I just can't take another sleepless night<br>
Bring me back to life<br>
Give me the clarity to see the light<br>
<br>
I know that you can take this away<br>
So I'm praying that today is the day<br>
Oh, I pray that today is the day<br>
Bring me back to life<br>
<br>
Why am I terrified of everything I used to love<br>
Save me from myself I don't want to hate who I've become<br>
Tell me that tomorrow when I wake up I'll be fine<br>
I just want to be myself again<br>
I want to know that I'm alive<br>
<br>
Please give me peace<br>
Give me joy<br>
Give me sanity,<br>
Give me hope<br>
Give me love<br>
Give me truth.</p>

            <p class="lyrics-test-test">I hit the bottom of my lowest lows<br>
My darkest hours are the times I grow<br>
And every time I am broken I know that it's only so I can be restored<br>
<br>
I never would have found my way<br>
If I didn't realize I was lost in the first place<br>
Amazing grace how sweet the sound<br>
I never could have picked myself up off the ground<br>
<br>
Oh now I see (now I see)<br>
It's not about the things I've done, but what you've done in me<br>
Now I see fear is irrelevant 'cause you know my every need<br>
<br>
I'm reaching out<br>
You pull me out of the depths, I see you now<br>
I'm letting go of the rest and I won't fear the fall<br>
'Cause I know that you'll be there to catch me<br>
I'll look to you when there's trouble at sea<br>
'Cause I can walk on water when I believe<br>
And now I know it's true, you are the answer to everything<br>
<br>
How could I fear this heartbeat that beats for you?<br>
How could I fear this heartbeat that beats for you?<br>
I'm letting go of every fear I hold on to<br>
<br>
Well I don't know what the future holds<br>
But I know who holds it and it's beautiful<br>
Every time that I fall short I'm so thankful I'm not in control<br>
I'm reaching out I see you now<br>
And I won't fear the fall 'cause I know that you'll be there<br>

And now I know it's true, you are the answer to everything<br>
(The answer to everything<br>
The answer to everything<br>
The answer to everything)<br>
<br>
When my thoughts take shape like a demon, I will rest in you (I will rest in you)<br>
The peace I find in my quiet mind comes from knowing that your word is true<br>
You are more than enough!<br>
ANd now I'm certain that the best is yet to come (best is yet to come)<br>
You are more than enough!<br>
The best is yet to come<br>
<br>
I'm reaching out<br>
You pull me out of the depths, I see you now<br>

            <p class="lyrics-test-test">
So caught up in our own day-to-day, we see lives in need & look the other way<br>
I'm not a pessimist, but I think it's safe to say this would be different if it was your family.<br>
We can't fathom not having a place to rest our heads<br>
Can you imagine the pain of a newborn child that won't be fed?<br>
It's so easy getting comfortable<br>
We ignore the empty hands in need, thinking someone else will see them<br>
<br>
Can you see the possibilities?<br>
We have the ability to change the World!<br>
If we want to see a change we have to be it<br>
Stand up & believe that the responsibility's ours!<br>
<br>
Day after day they continue to die so we think our prayers go unheard,<br>
but poverty ends where compassion begins<br>
We can no longer deny it's up to us<br>
It's up to us!<br>
We are the chosen ones, called to be bold!<br>
There is no time to hesitate<br>
Today is the day we can break the mold!<br>
<br>
Can you see the possibilities?<br>
We have the ability to change the World!<br>
If we want to see a change we have to be it<br>
Stand up & believe that the responsibility's ours!<br>
<br>
Their starving eyes cry out for anyone to listen,<br>
reaching out for anyone to care<br>
Would we ignore them now if they were our<br>
own children or make a promise to always be there?<br>
Remove the veil from your eyes!<br>
We could move mountains if we only tried!<br>
Remove the veil from your eyes!<br>
We hold the power in our hands to save their lives!<br>
<br>
Can you see the possibilities?<br>
We have the ability to change the World!<br>
If we want to see a change we have to be it<br>

I find my purpose when I look at you<br>
I bleed transparent<br>
It's not the way I choose<br>
But it's only when I'm vulnerable my true colors shine through<br>
<br>
For a moment<br>
I'm a poet without words<br>
Speechless because you love me at my worst<br>
I don't deserve this<br>
I let it surface<br>
And all I know is today I woke up falling in love again<br>
<br>
Starving artist, no match for a queen,<br>
But walls come down and<br>
Love's limitless when you find what's meant to be<br>
Supernatural, it's more than what we see<br>
A trust that can't be broken seemed impossible to me<br>
But I've tasted true love and I believe!<br>
<br>
For a moment<br>

it's been this way from day one<br>
Always an uphill battle, we never got a single handout from anyone, from anyone<br>
So tell me, if we were "damaged goods," then what does that make you?<br>
As far as I'm concerned, you're nothing more than just a worthless suit<br>
<br>
(We are the rose)<br>
We are the rose<br>
We are the rose that grew from the crack in the concrete<br>
I never doubted for a second even when you left us on our own<br>
Don't you wish you would have known?<br>
How does it feel now that you're in the back seat?<br>
I guess you should have had a little more faith in me<br>
<br>
Now I won't take all the credit, but you sure don't deserve an ounce<br>
So go & talk the talk while we walk the walk<br>
There's no way that you can stop us now!<br>

Because when they said we couldn't WE DID!<br>
One day you'll be forgotten<br>
When they said we couldn't WE DID!<br>
They'll remember our name forever, because when they said we couldn't WE DID!<br>

I forgive you<br>
It's not your fault you couldn't see what I saw<br>
You never were to care about the underdog<br>

Just when I think I've got it all figured out<br>

I'm at the top of the world & I feel it, but it's not enough for me<br>
No it's not enough for me!<br>
I used to think I'd find myself at the top above all the pain & the failure I saw<br>
Now that I'm here I see it's not what I wanted at all<br>

I feel it in my bones<br>
It's in my blood<br>
A constant search for the one true love<br>
Show me something real, I want to feel your touch<br>
What is enough?<br>
Show me enough!<br>

I'm at the top of the world & I feel it, but it's not enough for me<br>

Weighed down by all my mistakes and the chains I've worn<br>
A constant struggle with fear<br>
Unsure if I was enough from the day I was born<br>
