Who controls our lives and guides our way?<br>
Someone who would love a life of one or another,<br>
Perceiving smiles of faces with unfamiliar names.<br>
My blurred vision couldn't see what was right in front of me<br>
<br>
What was right in front of me.<br>
<br>
Grey seemed matching to my frame of mind.<br>
Head full of clouds and angry eyes.<br>
<br>
We disregard the real heart<br>
Choose elegance as a satisfaction<br>
Where does it lead us? Tell me where it will lead us.<br>
Where do we go from here.<br>
<br>
Strangers come alive at night when colours try to hide<br>
As long as we will fight for a new day, for a better day.<br>
<br>
Strangers come alive at night when colours try to hide<br>
As long as we will fight for a new day, for a better day.<br>
<br>
Now the sky will lead the way.<br>
Even when you feel like running away<br>
Or knowing that everything will be okay,<br>
To not follow what everyone says.<br>
<br>
I'll touch what you saw in colour,<br>
But to me it's just a part of my path.<br>
And I'll make sure it's under cover,<br>
Cause you won't take this all in.<br>
<br>
I watched the blind see what other can't witness.<br>
Seen the eyes of thousands, broke and helpless.<br>
I heard the deaf listen to the change of tomorrow.<br>
What does it take to overcome the fear and sorrow?<br>
<br>
Will we ever lighten up?<br>
Will we ever comprehend our meaning in life?<br>
My soul, my soul, my soul will lighten up the sky.</p>

I'm sick of making all the same mistakes over (and over) again<br>
Will I ever be left alone to mend?<br>
I'll never make all the same mistakes over and over again<br>
Now I've seen what I could become<br>
And I don't want to.<br>
<br>
I carried these burdens for too long.<br>
Went along with all the mess.<br>
But it has made me who I am today,<br>
Still standing after all these years.<br>
<br>
We are the living dead<br>
We are the living dead<br>
We are the living dead<br>
<br>
I know that this life is in our hands<br>
And I know that we wont last forever<br>
But let's make this chance our last.<br>
Don't be scared of any new endeavors<br>
<br>
When I'm the sun,<br>
I'll count the worlds and make them mine.<br>
Because when I'm the sun,<br>
I'll count the worlds and make them mine.<br>

I'm sick of making all the same mistakes over (and over) again<br>
Will I ever be left alone to mend?<br>
I'll never make all the same mistakes over and over again<br>

I don't want to become that no more.<br>
I'm over it, and I'm over it all...<br>

You know we’ve seen it all.<br>
We met the ones that live no more.<br>
Deceived your children you said you loved<br>
Fooled the ones that stood up for you.<br>
Your light will shine on, until everyone receives<br>
The hidden words of a million hearts.<br>
Behold your faith and carry on<br>

Read the headlines…<br>
What they say is anything but real.<br>
<br>
Now listen to what they tell you<br>
Nothing else will be retold<br>
These are the terms they gave you<br>
Walk away without a soul<br>
<br>
Because voices remain and mark your names.<br>
<br>
If you take your hands from your eyes<br>
You don’t know where we have been and died tonight<br>
With your eyes shut and reinforced<br>
They won’t stop until you pray for gold.<br>
As they begin to introduce their stories<br>
Enlighten all their bodies.<br>
What they do is pull you in,<br>
Have we forgotten how to deal with them?<br>
<br>
We’re victims of stories<br>
That don’t make sense to us.<br>

I’m holding this child and call it love<br>
Grab our history that we were tired of.<br>

I’m holding this gift and call it life.<br>
After breaking chains everything becomes alive.<br>
<br>
Everything becomes alive.<br>

Have you ever believed in something?<br>
Listened to tongues that shouldn’t mean anything.<br>

It goes on and on and I felt so alone<br>
As I grew up and grew old life began to unfold<br>
Heavy hearts filled with hope and the truth will be<br>
That there is something there but nothing wrong with me.<br>
<br>
And the truth will be<br>
That there is nothing wrong with me.<br>
<br>
With my head against those walls.<br>
My eyes were covered, my hands tied up<br>
And I’m still the same as I used to be,<br>
Sailing oceans just to be seen.<br>
<br>
Taking chances, breaking free.<br>
<br>
There’s one thing that I never did, its called giving up.<br>
<br>
It goes on and on and I felt so alone<br>
As I grew up and grew old life began to unfold<br>

When questions running through your head<br>
No answers, everything is still left unsaid, still left unsaid.<br>
How long will you ever pull through this?<br>
How long will it take for me to relearn how to live?<br>
Can we ever live again…<br>
<br>
I’ve been controlled<br>
And I had it all<br>
But the only thing I’ve been longing for<br>
Is the heart that I can’t hold<br>

Someone please pull my head out of the sand<br>
I’m getting worried that I keep losing track<br>
Running circles but it’s all in my mind<br>
So tell me why is my heart not dying inside<br>
<br>
Looking back to months and months<br>
Spent every single day<br>
Trying to keep up, trying to fight,<br>
Trying to get away.<br>
<br>
Am I better off without you?<br>
<br>
When I believed everything was working for me.<br>
I was worn out, besieged by those who betrayed.<br>
<br>
I was too blind to see, too scared to leave.<br>
I was everything I never ever wanted to be.<br>
<br>
With my head held high, I walked miles for nothing.<br>
But still remembered, everything is worth something.<br>

Seems like we are the only ones,<br>
Who accept everything and get told nothing<br>

Will it be the same as it always was<br>
Is it something that I always dreamt it could but never was.<br>
Too many things remain untold<br>
Don’t hide your tongues. Don’t hide at all.<br>

Can you see what’s changed, it won’t stay the same<br>
And now you take away the things I always dreamt about.<br>
Too many things remain untold<br>
Don’t hide your tongues. Don’t hide at all.<br>

This isn’t a joke for me, this is me not knowing what to believe.<br>

You will stand your ground as the sky comes down.<br>

Don’t hide your tongues. Don’t hide at all.<br>

Take to the skies, with your brothers<br>
Question everything, question everything<br>
Sing to the lost, with each other.<br>

Every word that you spat out was a single mistake<br>
Are we just cursed or dead? There’s no room to escape<br>
With lights shining bright and no goals to make,<br>
Was everything I asked too much guilt to take?<br>
<br>
You made me hate what I used to fucking love<br>
Made up stories that seemed like they were send straight from above<br>
<br>
They can’t measure heart,<br>
When love isn’t what I want<br>

Yet I’m still here shaking<br>
Yet I’m still here believing

How can they measure my heart?<br>
Does it go off the love or how many times I’ve been a broken man?<br>
Or how many times you left me here<br>

Did you ever look at a picture of yourself?<br>
It’s not the person that I see now<br>
And home doesn’t feel like home<br>

My past to the crows<br>

With both feet on the ground<br>
I wont pick you up this time<br>
Drowned everything I knew would hold me down.<br>

You picked up the stones which were meant to stay forever<br>
You teared down walls that were built to stay strong together<br>

I've written songs about you<br>
I wasted nights dreaming about you<br>

The cold will never be so cold, this is because of you<br>

So flawless from the outside.<br>
Never trust a stranger.<br>
Farewell to our hearts<br>
Remember the so called desire<br>
A brand new spirit destiny,<br>
Won’t let my mind play tricks on me.<br>
Closed chapters, opened curtains<br>
To let myself be focused.<br>
<br>
Through coldest nights we found ourselves marching.<br>
Summer nights were meant to save us,<br>
And stop us from aching.<br>
I don’t need another tragic ending,<br>
No time for precious glorifying.<br>
What’s left in me will be better shortly.<br>
<br>
I learnt too much, I’ve seen it all<br>
Was love suppose to feel like this?<br>
I can only run away<br>
Let my past drown inside of me.<br>
Let go and leave it all behind.<br>

There’s no life with clean breaks.<br>
No chance we can’t take.<br>
Forgiveness lies to deep<br>
To be vanished away.<br>

When you piece it all together<br>
Fragments of affection, come crawling back together<br>
It will never stop unless you make it,<br>

The fear is deep, the vision clear.<br>
But what am I suppose to see?<br>
<br>
It's all in your head, no clarity<br>
Leave behind who you used to be.<br>
<br>
Overcome your fears and sing<br>
"We are the reasons for tomorrow's end"<br>
<br>
We can change it all. We can stop this fall.<br>
We are the children of the new world.<br>
<br>
I'm ready to take on<br>
what was put in my way.<br>
If I hear that voice again I know<br>
I've got the world in front of me.<br>
<br>
Right in front of me<br>
<br>
If you're lost and alone how am I meant to know?<br>
Cause I'm just trying to help you out,<br>
and every time I hear your voice<br>
I've got the world in front of me<br>
<br>
I still have your words in my head<br>
They sound exactly like they used to<br>
I'm sorry I didn't know what it was like<br>
To be trapped and alone inside.<br>
<br>
We are the ones to full fill our dreams<br>
We're the storm chasing those lies away<br>
<br>
Are you strong enough to be leaving?<br>
Are you old enough to believe in…

I’d burn the world, just to show you I love you most.<br>
This dream’s my one foundation, my future’s held to sleep.<br>
The only way I know, how to set myself free.<br>

There is one thing I’ve learned and in fact I'm quite aware.<br>
If the world wants to see you fall it only takes one second to spare.<br>
I’ve got my eyes wide open so treat me right.<br>
I’ve got my hands on my heart so I feel alive.<br>
I’ve realized that the end isn’t suicide.<br>
I was born to live until I die.

All that's left is your conscious<br>

"Hold me nearer, Hold me nearer"<br>

Everything that you say<br>

If we see the light I won't pray for the unknown<br>
Will I be damned in hell if I don't follow your beliefs?<br>
When everything is changing<br>
When love is the only thing we need<br>
We shouldn't have to feel alone<br>

We would love each other more<br>

(Tell me why you broke our love)<br>
(Tell me why you broke our love)<br>
<br>
As the sky is falling you feel brand-new<br>
I see the gun you're holding but please don't shoot<br>
You know that you're all that I've got<br>
<br>
So tell me why you broke our love<br>
Tell me why you fucked our trust<br>
Show me why it's not enough<br>
Show me why I'm still here crying at a broken cross before you run run<br>
Tell me why you broke our love<br>
Tell me why you lost your trust<br>
Show me where it got too rough<br>
Show me why I'm still here crying at a broken cross before you run run<br>
Tell me why you broke our love<br>
<br>
(So tell me why you broke our love)<br>
(Tell me why you broke our love)<br>
(So tell me why you broke our love)<br>
(Tell me why you broke our love)</p>
