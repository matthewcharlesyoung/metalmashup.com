Just as the waves are continuous with the ocean.<br>

It's complicated<br>
I gave up<br>
On giving it a name<br>
Things are implied<br>
Nothing's the same<br>
Worried I won't remember where to begin<br>
I wish this would end<br>

What will it take for us?<br>
What will it take for us?<br>
What will it take for us to<br>

If you pray for us<br>
Pray for love<br>
It might just save us from<br>
It just might<br>
<br>
I made too much<br>
Overrated<br>
I gave too much<br>
As if there was something to gain<br>
Things are implied<br>
Nothing's the same<br>
Worried I won't remember where to begin<br>
We must decide<br>
<br>
If you pray for us<br>
Pray for love<br>
It might just save us from<br>
(It might just save us from)<br>
It just might<br>
Wish us godspeed<br>

            <p class="lyrics-test-test">When I found the point of life<br>
It came creeping towards me<br>
In the shape of I<br>
<br>
It was all this reimagined<br>
It was a different kind of speech<br>
It was repetition<br>
It was what you wanted to be<br><br>

When I saw the shape of sound<br>
Everything came spiralling<br>
<br>
It was all this reimagined<br>
It was a different kind of speech<br>
It was repetition<br>
It was what you wanted to be<br>
<br>
Oh, come find<br>
This caged me<br>
<br>
Breathe<br>
(Breathe)<br>
Breathe in<br>
(Breathe in)<br><br>
Once you found the breath you'd lost<br>
Breathe again<br>
Breathe<br>
(Breathe)<br>
Breathe in<br>
(Breathe in)<br>
Once you found the breath you'd lost<br>
Breathe again<br>
<br>
It was all this reimagined<br>
It was a different kind of speech<br>
It was repetition<br>
And I am exactly what you imagined me to be</p>

            <p class="lyrics-test-test">
You'd rather be in the dark than know what we know<br>
It's easier than to deal with illusions of pleasure<br>
It's easier<br><br>

What's the price of it<br>
What's the price to live<br>
We're only killing ourselves each and every day<br>
Despite what we believe<br>
There's a difference between<br>
what is and what else the perceiver knows<br>
The only colors they know and<br>
for these things they can't compose<br>
'Cause they don't know what I know<br>
They'll sell your souls for their gold<br>
And that's far too much for you<br>
I'd tell you these words, but I'll hold them<br>
And some say you already know<br>
You're clairvoyant<br><br>

What's the price of it<br>
If we kill ourselves a little bit<br>
Is it worth it<br>
Start is relative to end<br><br>
This has no price attached to it<br>
What's the price of it<br>
Fall down<br>
Fall down</p>

            <p class="lyrics-test-test">Since this began<br>
I've misplaced my head<br>
This all seems so nauseating<br>
Does it?<br>
<br>
Just let me sleep<br>
Just let me<br>
Until I feel free<br>
I can feel it sinking in<br>
Until I feel free<br>
I can feel it sinking in<br>
If you wish me anything<br>
<br>
Just wish me sleep<br>
Just wish me<br>
Until I feel free<br>
I can feel it sinking in<br>
I can feel it sinking in<br>
I feel a sinking feeling<br>
<br>
Just let me sleep<br>
Just let me<br>
Do you hear me know?<br>
Am I thinking loud?<br>
I don't want to come down<br>
I'm too proud<br>
Until I feel free<br>
I can feel it sinking in<br>
I feel a sinking feeling<br>
<br>
Just let me sleep<br>
Just let me sleep<br>
Just let me<br>

Do you see what I see now?<br>
Do you see what I see?<br>
Do you see what I see now?</p>

turned around<br>
What are you thinking about?<br>
What were we talking about now?<br>
Emotion-free, euphoric state<br>
Too little, too late<br>
<br>
You pray for rain in hopes that it'll wash away<br>
Well let's be honest<br>
You don't have that much faith<br>
I think it's too late if you're looking to save face<br>
I see you slipping from that throne of grace<br>
<br>
Focused on opening up<br>
You're thinking too loud<br>
All this comes as the comedown<br>
At least you can say you tried to pray for them<br>
<br>
You pray for rain in hopes that it'll wash away<br>
Well let's be honest<br>
You don't have that much faith<br>
I think it's too late if you're looking to save face<br>
I see you slipping from that throne of grace<br>
<br>
Why do we ask for these selfish ways?<br>
Are we the only ones that need saving?<br>
I think we were foolish in thought<br>
Then again I'm probably wrong<br>
I'm probably wrong<br>
<br>
You pray for rain in hopes that it'll wash away<br>
Well let's be honest<br>
You don't have that much faith<br>
I think it's too late if you're looking to save face<br>
I see you slipping from that throne of grace</p>

            <p class="lyrics-test-test">Noises, noises<br>
Are all I hear when you speak<br>
The point of it all left much faster than it crept to me<br>
If the relapse happens today<br>
Then let tomorrow be recovery<br>
All that you've been sold is fool's gold<br>
Predictable in nature so it seems<br><br>

They've clairvoyant<br>
They created your dependency<br>
They're clairvoyant<br>
If the relapse happens today<br>
Then let tomorrow be recovery<br>
All that you've been sold<br>
Fool's gold, all<br>
It's as if they already know all<br>
It's as if they already know<br><br>

They're clairvoyant<br>
They're clairvoyant<br>
Stuck in the lines that they prescribe<br>
This can't be what we need<br>
Recommended daily for dependency<br>
Best of luck with your recovery<br>
If the relapse happens today<br>
Then let tomorrow be recovery<br>
All that you've been sold<br>
Fool's gold, all<br>
It's as if they already know all<br>
It's as if they already know

            <p class="lyrics-test-test">Return to the earth<br>
Rain on black clouds<br>
Return to the earth<br>
Return to the earth<br><br>

Wasn't technically perfect<br>
Could it have been any better?<br>
Was the fall worth it?<br>
I don't feel any better<br><br>

And you were so sick<br>
You were skin and bones<br>
So you fed yourself excuses<br>
Just to keep it going<br>
Nodding on and on<br>
(Nodding on and on)<br>
Raining on and on<br>
(Raining on and on)<br><br>

So keep on slipping 'til the end of the earth<br>
Like a ghost sinking into the ground<br>
Keep on slipping 'til the end of the earth<br>
Now that all these black clouds<br>
Keep on raining down<br><br>

Wasn't technically perfect<br>
Could it have been any better?<br>
Falling faster and faster<br>
Do you still feel clever?<br>
Couldn't stop the momentum<br>
Couldn't stop you from crashing<br>
Wish that I had seen it coming<br><br>

And you were so sick<br>
You were skin and bones<br>
So you fed yourself excuses<br>
Just to keep it going<br>
Nodding on and on<br>
(Nodding on and on)<br>
(Nodding on and on)<br>
Raining on and on<br>
(Raining on and on)<br><br>

So keep on slipping 'til the end of the earth<br>
Do you remember what was said?<br>
You could lose the sleep<br>
All of those nauseous things<br>
I'll have you know<br>
It didn't take long<br>
I'd bring you back to Earth<br><br>

Return to the earth<br>
And if you come down<br>
Return to the earth<br><br>

So keep on slipping 'til the end of the earth<br>
Like a ghost sinking into the ground<br>
Keep on slipping 'til the end of the earth<br>
Now that all these black clouds<br>
Keep on raining.</p>

Breathe in<br>
Sink in<br>
I bet you couldn't sleep<br>
I bet you couldn't see with the tunnel vision that you had<br><br>

(Keeps on raining)<br>
(Keeps on raining)<br><br>

I bet you couldn't breathe<br>
I bet you couldn't breathe when your lungs collapsed<br><br>

(Keeps on raining)<br>
(Keeps on raining)<br><br>

I know you felt alone<br>
I know you felt it in your bones<br>
I could feel it in my teeth<br>
I know you couldn't sleep<br>
(If only you would find your mind)<br>
Worried I can't remember where to begin<br>
Misplaced my mind, presupposition<br>
But you didn't know what you should've done<br>
Maybe I shouldn't have had another one<br><br>

Maybe I'm just desperate to think<br>
you'd be fine after you lost your mother<br>
I guess that I thought that you'd be alright<br>
Are you alright?<br>
I wish you the best<br>
I wish you godspeed<br>
I wish you the rest<br><br>
And now you can sleep<br>
They say that life goes on<br>
Can't imagine how you missed her<br>
But tell me where have you gone<br>
Where was I when you called home<br>
It's just not that easy when all that's<br>
left is just all your bones</p>
