I gaze into an exalted mirror.<br>
Its reflection left an affection<br>
That had long been absent.<br>
<br>
A continual electric pulse of life.<br>
<br>
This creature has become my father.<br>
A giant reaping what he has sown.<br>
Absorbed in the darkness of glacial dead water.<br>
This sentient creature has touched the vast unknown.<br>
Touch the vast unknown.<br>
<br>
Life is found where it is taken.<br>
A vapor in the wind cycles.<br>
Replaced when the ground is shaken.<br>
Nature is an equal to mankind.<br>

This celestial entity<br>
That I had been (I had been)<br>
Pursuing delivered my spirit<br>
That was forever imprisoned.<br>

When things fall apart who will take my hand?<br>

Every night I'm beside you weeks away when you're sleeping alone<br>
Did you ever know how much I meant it?<br>

Millions of tiny pieces looking in on themselves<br>
Reflected in the water, unaware of each other<br>
Every piece could find its place back in the puzzle<br>
What was one is shattered into many and longs to be whole again<br>
But nothing ever fits quite the same in the end<br>

I know too well there's one more thing I could have said<br>

Months pass, sitting still, thinking in this box<br>
Where my thoughts are not friendly nor hopeful<br>
This weak mind and body crumble<br>
<br>
Who we were will never be the same<br>
We'll never relive the feeling<br>
Love we made, we let it slip away<br>
And I just can't face it<br>
<br>
I can feel it coming on, living inside<br>
Calling me right back to you<br>
My regret meets no resistance<br>
And I endorse this torment to feel<br>
If you exhaust a heart of love<br>
Is the pumping of blood still enough?<br>
Do the limbs go numb?<br>
<br>
Who we were will never be the same<br>
We'll never relive the feeling<br>
Love we made, we let it slip away<br>
And I just can't face it<br>
Who we were will never be the same<br>
We'll never relive the feeling<br>
Love we made, we let it slip away<br>
And I just can't face it<br>
<br>
My fictional friend, conducting me piece by piece<br>
I feel your cold blank stare cast on me<br>
I don't ask to be mended<br>
Just understand my words and hear me out<br>
All the passion has faded<br>
All the fire has burned out<br>
<br>
How could I see it coming?<br>
This electrifying high that we would grow to resent<br>
<br>
I can feel it coming on, living inside<br>
Calling me right back to you</p>

          <h1 id="t9" class="lyrics-test">-Unify-</h1>
          <p class="lyrics-test-test">Aiming soft steps along each brick<br>
To give respect in the places unfit<br>
It's not a waste to him, but all he knows<br>
Avoiding all the conflict to seek some repose<br>
Thinking back on his father's words<br>
To try and mend the cracks at the seams<br>
Stand your ground and speak your mind<br>
A unity he can't emphasize<br>
Hard rain falls without consulting the flood<br>
A tear hits the cheek of a heartless man<br>
Counting the minutes as you lose control<br>
This love goes unreceived, marked "return to sender"<br>
<br>
Feeling it all around me<br>
Watching the clouds roll over<br>
Fall into place; trust in the outcome<br>
Walk along the path of least resistance<br>
<br>
Set your feet to paths for you to wander and never feel alone<br>
Questioning the option to surrender, embracing the unknown on your own<br>
<br>
Walk alone or lead the pack on your own<br>
There's no difference in numbers<br>
If you see nothing with eyes wide open<br>
Remembering moments being led astray<br>
The howling voices looming close behind<br>
Reaching for a piece to steal away<br>
Close your doors even if the rooms are vacant<br>
<br>
Set your feet to paths for you to wander and never feel alone<br>
Questioning the option to surrender, embracing the unknown<br>
<br>
Setting all the clocks to prior hours to stagger fleeting time<br>
Saving all the love you can remember, remember<br>
<br>
Thinking back on his father's words<br>
To try and mend the cracks at the seams<br>
Stand your ground and speak your mind<br>
A unity he can't emphasize</p>

          <h1 id="t10" class="lyrics-test">-Ultimata-</h1>
          <p class="lyrics-test-test">Terror creeps like a hurricane<br>
Oppressing the seas, trying to sink my vessel<br>
Powerless to the crippling wake<br>
Pull me in and destroy my faith<br>
With my liquid lungs, I can breathe<br>
<br>
Free of broken memories that keep holding on<br>
Contemplating love you spent only to feel alone<br>
I feel alone<br>
Love you spent only to feel alone<br>
Still holding on<br>
<br>
A hollow heart holds no peace<br>
Can we forgive and forget, receive and protect<br>
When we carry our prisons in our heads?<br>
Carve my legacy into the stone<br>
For my light can only burn so long<br>
But before I go, my brimstone bones<br>
Will smolder all my fears of the unknown<br>
<br>
Free of broken memories that keep holding on<br>
Contemplating love you spent only to feel alone<br>
I feel alone<br>
Love you spent only to feel alone<br>
And no strength to let it go<br>
<br>
In my wishing well, where all my words turn to stone<br>
Speak to me through grit teeth; a broken soul<br>
And a heart that wants to take control<br>
<br>
Who's to say whether we should drift?<br>
I can feel you slipping away<br>
<br>
Shadows unfamiliar to me<br>
Dance around the walls of the most familiar places<br>
Now I've become a stranger in my own home<br>
I'd fall asleep with you next to me, now every day I wake alone<br>
<br>
Shadows of strangers compose themselves reluctantly<br>
How can you confront your fears when they stand back to back?<br>
Trust in a disconnect to make the pieces fit, oh<br>
Shadows of strangers<br>
Shadows of strangers<br>
<br>
Hope you left behind<br>
Home is undefined<br>
Hope you left behind<br>
Home is undefined</p>
