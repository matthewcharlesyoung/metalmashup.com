Friends and family, I'm losing all ties.<br><br>
Staring at the walls to pass the time.<br>
Pinch myself; make sure I'm still alive.<br>
I've been here before.<br>
I will survive another month under gray skies.<br>
I'm holding on as a tight as I can.<br>

Every day feels the same.<br>
Every day I think about the place I'd rather be than here.<br>
I've been here before.<br>
I will survive another month under these grey skies.<br>
We've carried each other through and over the seas.<br><br>
We live for nights like this.<br>
The ones we won't forget.<br>
I hope to open my eyes to see this picture.<br>
I'm throwing it all away.<br>
I hope to open my eyes to see this moment that I should treasure forever.<br><br>
Staring at the walls to pass the time.<br>
Pinch myself; make sure I'm still alive.<br>

Coming home, I don't know when.<br>
I'm holding on as tight as I can.<br><br>

My dearest love, I woke up tired today, even more so than yesterday.<br>
How that's possible,<br>
I don't even know,<br>
nor do I want to.<br>
It's hard to find the motivation when you are this drained.<br>
My body aches but I'm used to feeling this way.<br>
Seventeen down, seventeen to go.<br>
That's not so bad, right?<br><br>
I think of home often and of you even more.<br>
Yesterday I saw the sun shining.<br>
It appeared for a few minutes just after two.
For a moment I found myself smiling,<br>
as if those short rays of light were enough to get me by.<br>
Maybe that was enough.<br>
Thank God, I needed that.<br>
I surely needed that.</p>

Afterwards feeling motionless (motionless)<br><br>

I keep breaking my promises<br>
I keep breaking my word to you and I<br>

How must a broken man fix his brokenness if he's not the answer?<br><br>

I can't do this on my own<br>
On my own<br>
I need you here (here)<br>
I need you here (here)<br>
I need you here<br>

Each and every day that passes leaves me worse off than before<br>
Many times I've sworn I wouldn't look back, never look back<br><br>

Instead of fighting to be a man<br>
I just wanna know who I am<br><br>

Fighting with my fists leaves me bloody and broken<br>
Almost every single time<br><br>

so I'm going at it with your strength instead of mine<br>
Please be my strength<br>
so I'm going at it with your strength instead of mine<br>
Please be my strength<br><br>

I need you here<br>
I need you here!<br>

I've carried this burden long enough<br>
With a heart of conviction<br>
I've betrayed us both<br>
I have to forfeit<br>
The shame is too much to...<br>
Take the lead and reign over me<br>
Reign, reign<br>
Reign over me<br>
Reign, reign<br>
Reign over me<br><br>

You knew you'd find me here (find me here)<br>
It took me losing sight<br>
To count it all as lost (all as lost)<br>
To see that I'm finally found<br><br>

Count it all as lost<br>
There's so much more to gain<br>
Count it all as lost<br>
Take the lead and reign over me

Rarely the rare are seen<br>
In the ocean of chaotic reality<br>
This lighthouse gives direction, caution, and awareness<br>
In the dark and distant, this man is still seenv
His fierce devotion to what he believes<br>
Is true, as he feels the weight of this collapsed nation<br><br>

Staring into the face of adversity<br>
He will remain<br>
With courage and bravery (and bravery)<br>
It keeps him walking towards the flames<br>
He will remain<br>
In good faith that he will remain<br><br>

"Our existence is an imprint<br>
We all have a legacy to live,"<br>
He says to me (he will remain)<br>
"Our existence is an imprint<br>

His grace is such a blessing<br>
Surely it's something to write home about<br>
Its presence never recognized while life passes by<br>
Never stopping to thank you<br>
"Be calm, just sleep<br>
Let your heavy spirit rest its knees<br><br>
You've been running for so many years,"<br>
He says to me, he says to me<br>
A true inspiration, a light in the dark and distant<br>
I stop my life to thank you<br>
You have carried me through the storm<br>
Through its heavy winds, I stop my life to thank you<br><br>

Rarely the rare are seen<br>
What's seen as defeat is his philosophy<br>
Better to be a one-man army<br>
Than a cavalry hurdling the weak<br>
He brings comfort to the masses in the name of compassion<br><br>
His merit, his amour<br>
Clears the path for the broken down and defeated<br>
To see the masterpiece that's painted in our names<br>
"What we see is not all we believe," (we believe!)<br>
He will remain<br>
"What we see is not all we believe," (we believe!)<br>
He will remain</p>

Circumstantial hope isn't really hope<br>
It's just a watered down distraction from what stands in our way<br>
Hope gives us the ability to face reality, the ability to see through it all

But I know it's never ending<br>
Words give meaning to my thoughts<br>
What gives meaning to this feeling?<br><br>

I know what I did, I know what I said<br>
I know what I did, I know what I said<br><br>

It's dangerous, so dangerous<br>
I've made friends with a stranger, it's endangering us<br>
It's dangerous, so dangerous<br>
I've made friends with a stranger, it's endangering us<br><br>

When what you love is taken away<br>
You realize what you're made of<br>
You'll have to find your way<br>
You'll have to scream and claw at the air<br><br>
You strapped your pack to your back<br>
And all the weight is yours to bear<br>
The help we find is the hope we need<br>
It's the hand that guides us back<br>
We can will ourselves to remember our word<br>
But we all too quickly forget<br><br>

Along the way I got lost<br>
Now the way back home is overgrown<br>
This isn't an addictive thought<br>
It's a ravenous feeling, ravenous feeling<br>
Conviction must be greater than life's afflictions<br>
I follow in my own footsteps<br><br>
Rather than following classical conditioning<br><br>

I wish I had the will to keep my word<br>

I'm looking back to face what's ahead (It's dangerous)<br>
I faced danger and it finally fled (It's dangerous)<br>
I'm looking back to face what's ahead (It's dangerous)<br>
I faced danger and it finally fled (It's dangerous)

            <h1 id="ff11" class="lyrics-test">-Carbon Copy-</h1>
            <p class="lyrics-test-test">This is our burden<br>
The pain we endure<br><br>

We must carry it together<br>
It will soon become a memory<br>
It's staring us in the face<br>
but we just turn the other way<br><br>

Take the easy route while millions of people's homes fall to the ground<br>
Merciless and unforgiving as it sets us back<br>
The truth could bury us all in the end<br><br>

You and I walk carefully<br>
As we lighten our step and hope that our tracks just disappear<br>
We don't want to leave an imprint<br>
This can't be what we're known for<br><br>

I'll leave the world as it was given to me<br>
Flowing full of life, filled with diversity<br>
I'll leave the world as it was given to me<br>
Flowing full of life, filled with diversity<br>
I can look with pride in my child's eyes<br>
And he will know<br>
I helped preserve what may have diedv
And he will know<br>
What I've done<br>
(He will know, he will know)<br><br>

We will look ahead<br>
The trail I've left won't lead the history books<br>
Right back to me, right back to me<br>
This generation won't let it all<br>
Just slip away, slip away<br>
Don't let it slip away<br><br>

I'll walk forward and sense the ground beneath me<br>
The choice is mine, I need to make the right one<br>
The earth may remember what we have done<br>
The choice is mine, I need to make the right one</p>
