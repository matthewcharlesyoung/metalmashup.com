And now I understand<br>

Trying to wrap my mind around how I can be useful<br>
I've been defiant because I know what's in store (know what's in store)<br>

Is you don't lose your faith in God by blaming Him for your anger<br>
Behind humanity constantly failing (constantly failing)<br>
You've lost all faith in yourself<br>
And you can't continue to live like this for the rest of your time<br>
<br>
Is this the life that you hoped for?<br>
Is this the life that you made?<br>
Burning every bridge with the ones you meet along the way<br>
<br>
Death rests at the tip of your tongue<br>
Your words spread like poison across the horizon<br>
Death rests at the tip of your tongue<br>
Your words spread like poison on their lives<br>
<br>
You believe we're so easily misguided<br>
Always bringing false hope<br>
You break the silence when you find out who you are<br>
Look at me, I need to know how you got this far<br>
<br>
I wish you could see that desolation's not foreign to you<br>
All your decisions have left you for dead<br>
The crown of apathy rests on your head<br>
And you've yet to be phased<br>
The crown of apathy is burned on your soul<br>
<br>
The only time you'll ever wonder where you went wrong (where you went wrong)<br>
Is when your world falls apart on you<br>
And you have nothing left to lose<br>
<br>
You want to bring back the ones that you abused<br>
These bitter years of this life you're living<br>
They have nothing to prove<br>
<br>
You breathe fire and ice while walking a thin line<br>
Making it known you can't make up your mind<br>
You breathe fire and ice while walking a thin line<br>
Making it known you can't make up your mind<br>

In a world where We thrive off hurt and confusion<br>
It's been whispered in our minds that it's just a phase<br>

But this state of intertwining's overdue for its last<br>
We listen, we accept thinking it will pass<br>

We have strayed from the disease that can take our system hostage<br>
Never will I compare myself to the gold that you claim<br>
Never will I settle in this grave that you call home<br>

It's not enough, it's not enough, it's not enough<br>
I won't settle any longer<br>
This is the point when you suffer<br>

This is the pursuit<br>
I play the game to win,<br>
Get to the bottom of this<br>
Turn a blind eye to your blind faith<br>
I will not bow down<br>
I control my fate<br>
Show me something more than the words in your script<br>
Prove it to me</p>

        <h1 id="s7" class="lyrics-test">-Empath-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Truth is a matter of context<br>
Every idea, every value<br>
Can you prove it better than the rest?<br>
We're all the same<br>
You're no better than the rest of us<br><br>
You forged a tomb<br>
Disguised as a shelter<br>
You lit the fuse<br>
Now face your deadline<br><br>
The innocent sentenced to a hell<br>
Pursing capital, turn your head away as they plead for your help<br>
Well they all had a story to tell<br>
Now, try not to look away as they burn<br>
So much damage done,<br>
How long until you realize<br>
This is our last shot?<br>
Truth is a matter of context<br><br>
Every value<br>
Can you prove it better than the rest?<br>
We're all the same<br>
You forged a tomb<br><br>
Disguised as a shelter<br>
You lit the fuse<br>
Now face your deadline</p>

        <p class="lyrics-test-test">I see the world in every shade<br>
I know exactly who you are and who you need me to be<br><br>
But is it all for one, or one against all?<br>
Always forsaking the past and fearing what lies ahead<br>
And this pursuit of certainty has only ended in rivalry<br>
Lives engulfed by the friction, united only by division<br>
"Now we have the light"<br>
Your collective battle cries,<br>
"Our notion will prevail, all others will surely die"<br><br>
"Now we have the light"<br>
Forever chasing a new harmony<br>
Can't you see your light is a fabrication from a false source?<br>
Ever-changing, transformation hasn't run its course<br>
You and I will never see the same<br>
Set apart by the differences on this page<br>
It's okay, I'll embrace my solitary state<br><br>
I see the world in every shade<br>
I know, exactly who you are and who you need me to be<br>
It's one against all</p>

        <h1 id="s10" class="lyrics-test">-Pandemica-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">A new light that guides my way<br>
A new path beneath my feet<br>
Breaking through the stone where roots are showing, a tree is growing<br>
There is no "one way"<br>
No need to follow suit.<br><br>
Every stage has its purpose<br>
Every branch will bear its fruit<br>
Can you see earth's on its deathbed?<br>
Fading light, on borrowed time<br>
Can we let go of our pride?<br>
We must relinquish this fight<br><br>
And now I see we've found a new way<br>
We have discarded the desire to follow suit<br>
Every stage serves its purpose<br>
Every branch will bear its fruit<br>
Can you see earth's on its deathbed?<br>
Fading light, on borrowed time<br>
Can we let go of our pride?<br>
We must relinquish this fight<br><br>
Cast regard to the sky as the tides rise<br>
Virtue shallows<br>
The masses' demise:<br><br>
A world at war<br>
Can you see earth's on its deathbed?<br>
Fading light, on borrowed time<br>
Can we let go of our pride?<br>
We must relinquish this fight</p>
