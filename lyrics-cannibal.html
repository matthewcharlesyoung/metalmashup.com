Run - the chase begins<br>
Terror - they're closing in<br>
Must attempt to refrain from defeat<br>
Done - fallen to the ground<br>
Clawing - disturbing sounds<br>
Can't escape the gnashing of their teeth<br>

Tearing off the outer skin to invade the inside<br>
Sanguinary mastication now the pain is increased<br>
Slashing of the arteries, completely defiled<br>
Bleeding out and soon to rot - carrion feast<br>
<br>
They cannot stop the craving for more blood!!!<br>
<br>
Attacking with no sign of remorse<br>
Nothing can stop this showing of force<br>
A virulent onslaught - rotten, decayed<br>
As they continue to feed on the corpse<br>

Wading through the darkness<br>
A death before the light<br>
Blending in with faces<br>
Faces of the night<br>
Safe at home in comfort<br>
At home is where you'll die<br><br>

Watching you<br>
Knowing your every move<br>
Hearing you<br>
Every single word that you spew<br>
Carving you<br>
Is what I'm about to do<br>
Saving you<br>
From the torment of this earth to be buried for rebirth<br>

Silently I enter through the broken basement window now to wait<br>
It's twelve o'clock the time has come ascend the staircase to the hunted one<br>
Make way to the second floor right outside your open bedroom door<br>
One last time to sleep in peace unaware of brutal things that<br>
<br>
Will be done<br>
To you after you awake<br>
Enter slow<br>
Machete leads the way<br>
Eerie calm<br>
Death is in the air<br>
Savage thrust<br>
Death is everywhere<br><br>

Adrenaline is pumping as my heart is pounding faster yours slows down<br>
Choke on blood and breathe your last breath mangled<br>
guts I wear to celebrate<br>
Stay inside and fuck the corpse an innards orgy satisfies my needs<br>
Finally I feel complete by eating brains and flesh<br>

Followed home then killed<br>
Sacrificed in vain<br>
Followed home then killed<br>
I stalked you for years<br>
Followed home then killed<br><br>

Take what's left in garbage bags and throw them in a hole I dug out back<br>
Clean the room I killed you in making sure the clues of sin are gone<br>
Revel in my vicious deed and replay what had happened in my head<br>
Vivid memories of you remain of your remains<br>

Followed home then killed<br>
Sacrificed in vain<br>

          <p class="lyrics-test-test">Up from the depths of creation<br>
To dwell among a world for the weak<br>
Confined to this creature of foreign flesh substance<br>
Reformed from within<br>
A savage conclusion impending<br>
Demonic invasion of a dominant hierarchy<br>
<br>
Alternate paths of temptation<br>
In tongues an evil purity will speak<br>
Symbolic redemption through an imminent transformation<br>
<br>
Human in form but not of this earth, species reborn<br>
Blood uniform is worn in disgust, will violently be shredded and torn<br>
Human in form, a vicious rebirth from not of this earth, species reborn<br>
Blood uniform is worn in disgust, will violently be shredded and torn<br>
<br>
Slow slicing<br>
Mutating through the blood<br>
Self carving<br>
Erupting from within<br>
<br>
Shedding my human skin<br>
<br>
Human in form but not of this earth, species reborn<br>
Blood uniform is worn in disgust, will violently be shredded and torn<br>
Human in form, a vicious rebirth from not of this earth, species reborn<br>

          <p class="lyrics-test-test">All that remains<br>
Are those that were remaimed<br>
<br>
Crush the village and plunder<br>
Like many times before<br>
Rape the women and slaughter all the children<br>
Everyone is mangled and deformed<br>
They all have lost a limb or two<br>
With another one to follow<br>
Decaying torn off penises<br>
Which the men were made to chew and swallow<br>
<br>
Subjected to these atrocities<br>
Like many times before<br>
The women bore bastard children who were mangled and deformed<br>
Born without a limb or two<br>
Like it fucking matters<br>
At most they'll live for several years until the next raid occurs<br>
<br>
The first time they came<br>
All were horribly maimed<br>
And every time after<br>
Remaimed through sick laughter<br>
Remaimed<br>
<br>
Remaimed until they die<br>
Die from being maimed again<br>
Remaimed<br>
<br>
The first time they came<br>
All were horribly maimed<br>
And every time after<br>
Remaimed through sick laughter<br>
Remaimed<br>

Remaimed until they die<br>
Die from being maimed again<br>

Firestorm vengeance<br>
Firestorm vengeance<br>

They sought to oppress<br>
Under duress<br>
Never thinking of this day<br>
<br>
No cheeks were turned<br>
Now the bodies burn<br>
And the tyrants writhe in pain<br>
<br>
No mercy for the merciless<br>
The time for that has passed<br>
<br>
Flagellate before they burn<br>
They scream with every lash<br>
<br>
Ravaging their halls of torture and death<br>
Craving retribution<br>
Winds of hatred fan the flames<br>
Reprisal's conflagration<br>
<br>
Firestorm vengeance<br>
Firestorm vengeance<br>
Firestorm vengeance<br>

Searing heat chars their flesh<br>
Burning judgment<br>
Punish them<br>

Furious inferno<br>
They cry in pain<br>
No mercy<br>
<br>
Firestorm<br>
Payback for their crimes<br>
<br>
No escape from this hell<br>
They will burn here<br>
Flames consume<br>
<br>
Bodies burnt to the bone<br>
Reduced to coals<br>
The oppressors pay<br>

Firestorm<br>
Persecution ends<br>
Firestorm<br>
Despot burn in hell<br>

          <p class="lyrics-test-test">Back in Nam he killed a man<br>
A shovel was used to cut his head off<br>
Now forever changed lust to decapitate<br>
Chop at the neck to keep the skull intact<br>
<br>
Going insane<br>
Come back deranged<br>
<br>
He buries his victims<br>
Only the heads exposed<br>
The screams don't bother him<br>
But he likes to make them stop<br>
<br>
Eyes wide open<br>
As they see the shovel<br>
Coming at them slowly<br>
Blood spurts through the air<br><br>
Head detaches from the body<br>
The eyes can still see but<br>
The brain starts to die rapidly<br><br>

Back in Nam he killed a man<br>
Many more would die<br>
Shovels used to cut their heads off<br><br>
Now forever changed lust to decapitate<br>
Chop at the neck to keep the skull intact<br>

Going insane<br>
Come back deranged<br><br>

The open neck holes fester<br>
Ravaged by the vultures
Bodies for the insects and<br>
The skulls are for the collection<br><br>
Brains and eyes are eaten<br>
Gnaw the skin though rotten<br>
Only bones will remain but<br>
The skulls are for the collection<br><br>

Killings confirmed by the hundreds<br>
Were carried out after the war in due time<br><br>
Killings confirmed by the thousands<br>
Were carried out after the war with his mind<br>

Heads shoveled off</p>
