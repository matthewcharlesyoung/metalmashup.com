Now I fall headfirst through this abysmal hole
</p>

        <h1 id="s8" class="lyrics-test">-Graymail-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">To the prisons with those who disobey<br>
Where they shall rot and decay<br>
And to the few who dare deceive me<br>
Your heads will roll on the pavement beneath me<br>
<br>
I will unhinge this world<br>
My endless reign is all that I can see<br>
I will unhinge this world<br>
Knell at my feet or die in the streets<br>
<br>
Your ridicule has made me what I am<br>
What I am<br>
<br>
To the honest men I've broken apart<br>
But they fail to understand<br>
That their ridicule has made me what I am<br>
<br>
To the prisons with those who disobey<br>
Where they shall rot and decay<br>
And to the few who dare deceive me<br>
Your heads will roll on the pavement beneath me<br>
<br>
The hate you placed that made yourself crave ending<br>
Famished ambition to eradicate you<br>
When you're cast out, when you seek forgiveness<br>
May you then realize your worthless existence<br>
<br>
The red stains<br>
The red stains<br>
<br>
To the honest men I've broken apart (broken apart)<br>
But they fail to understand<br>
That their ridicule has made me what I am<br>
<br>
Stained in red<br>
<br>
The rodents will feast on your insides<br>
Your ridicule has made me what I am<br>
Your ridicule has made me what I am

        <p class="lyrics-test-test">We should not expect<br>
The worst from ourselves<br>
Or it's all we'll receive<br>
We should not descend<br>
Below our own selves<br>
We'll get trapped underneath<br>
<br>
We lie in suffrage<br>
We're treated as mistakes<br>
Feeling defeated<br>
With crippled spirits<br>
But we refuse to break<br>
Our hearts not depleted<br>
<br>
No control<br>
We're unsustainable<br>
On the ropes<br>
Fighting and capable<br>
Standing at the edge<br>
Are we still worth it<br>
No control<br>
We're non retainable<br>
Lost in smoke<br>
But we're not replaceable<br>
Clinching to our pledge<br>
We are not worthless<br>
<br>
We lie in suffrage<br>
We're treated as mistakes<br>
Feeling defeated<br>
With crippled spirits<br>
But we refuse to break<br>
<br>
Our hearts not depleted<br>
<br>
No control<br>
We're unsustainable<br>
On the ropes<br>
Fighting and capable<br>
<br>
We lie in suffrage<br>
We're treated as mistakes<br>
Feeling defeated<br>
<br>
Weakness overwhelms us all<br>
Tranquil thoughts will overcome

        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Along the way<br>
Mistakes were made, they'll call it fate<br>
A world of slaves<br>
Driven insane and thrown away<br>
<br>
Like birds to worms<br>
We don't need them, we just feed them<br>
None of our concerns<br>
Will ever reach them, we are beneath them<br>
<br>
Deprivation<br>
Annihilation<br>
<br>
Along the way<br>
Mistakes were made, they'll call it fate<br>
A world of slaves<br>
Driven insane and thrown away<br>
<br>
A world of slaves<br>
<br>
Among the ones who've given up<br>
Loathing and dead weight<br>
Has held us down for long enough<br>
We'll forge a pathway<br>
<br>
Nothing is seamless<br>
Reset the sequence<br>
<br>
A world of slaves<br>
<br>
Along the way<br>
Mistakes were made, they'll call it fate<br>
A world of slaves<br>
Driven insane and thrown away<br>

A world of slaves</p>

        <h1 id="s11" class="lyrics-test">-Follow Me-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">In slavery of the blood thirst<br>
Drink from their hearts<br>
If your brother shows mercy<br>
Tear him apart<br>
<br>
(Clean)<br>
Follow me through the winds that curse our name<br>
Out into the lands of the slain<br>
<br>
These machines will not see defeat<br>
As they sever your arteries<br>
Mindless skeletons under control<br>
Slay them all 'til their blood is cold!<br>
Watch their limbs fall at your feet<br>
Move your eyes<br>
Through which I can see<br>
With your hands, tear through their flesh<br>
Don’t bother cleaning the mess<br>
Kill all the rest<br>
Beg to be freed<br>
You’re wasting your breath<br>
As you try and speak<br>
Under siege<br>
Brought to your knees<br>
Your imminent death awaits as you plead<br>
Suffering<br>
Follow me, follow me into the land of the slain<br>
Cursing their names we ride<br>
Follow me, follow me into the land of the slain<br>
Cursing their names tonight

        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Decide<br>
Live or die with those who dare defy<br>
Stand up and testify<br>
Breathing in dark poison<br>
Toxins ripping apart your skin<br>
Lungs are burnt wide open<br>
Let the black smoke fill and close them<br>
<br>
Looking back again<br>
Every single thing in this world will end<br>
Broken once again<br>
We will never last in this pit of sin<br>
Shame looks over us<br>
Deepening the feeling of remorsefulness<br>
Regret<br>
<br>
We must not resist<br>
Genocide will end this pit of sin<br>
Take out your knives and claim all of their lives<br>
Leave cadavers where they lie mangled alive<br>
Run for your lives as death follows behind<br>
Now the reaper has arrived<br>
<br>
Try to survive<br>
<br>
Those who deny my name will finally die<br>
All your organs will be mine<br>
Take out their eyes<br>
I will decide your fate for you tonight<br>
Hold their heads up towards the sky<br>
Tear out their spines<br>
<br>
Try to survive<br>
<br>
I've ruled over a thousand suns<br>
My destiny has seen itself through<br>
I have avenged my suffrage<br>
The torment now feasts on the minds of my people<br>
You shall always and forever know my pain<br>
The very pain which you have brought upon me<br>
And in the end I will be no more<br>
Deep inside all I want is to die<br>
My rise is my demise

<p class="lyrics-test-test">From the dust<br>
I rose up and brought hell<br>
Unchained but captivate<br>
In hate I dwell<br>
The power controls me<br>
Darkness, the Goddess who knows me<br>
<br>
I'm ashamed of what I've become<br>
Sick of myself<br>
Sick of being numb<br>
I'm ashamed of what I've become<br>
I am not enough<br>
I have given up<br>
<br>
I'm not who I was<br>
(Who I was)<br>
And I wish I was a better man<br>
But I am who I am<br>
(Who I am)<br>
I crawl from the dust<br>
(From the dust)<br>
And I've never seemed to understand<br>
But this is who I am<br>
(Who I am)<br>
<br>
I've disgraced this crown of blood<br>
I am simply not enough<br>
Forgive me for giving up<br>
Salvation can't save what I've done<br>
Lost and stricken with despair<br>
Crippled kingdom lies unrepaired<br>
Despair<br>
<br>
I long for the moment I no longer breathe air<br>
<br>
I'm not who I was<br>
(Who I was)<br>
And I wish I was a better man<br>
But I am who I am<br>
(Who I am)<br>
I crawl from the dust<br>
(From the dust)<br>
And I've never seemed to understand<br>
But this is who I am<br>
(Who I am)<br>
<br>
I've disgraced this crown of blood<br>
I am simply not enough<br>
Forgive me for giving up<br>
Salvation can't save what I've done<br>
Lost and stricken with despair<br>
Crippled kingdom lies unrepaired<br>
Despair<br>
<br>
Accept my fate<br>
Ascending now skywards<br>
My body shakes, the top of this tower<br>
I face the ground as I lean my weight forward<br>
Their digital eyes watch as I fall downward<br>
A final inception, it calls through the air<br>
I pray as I'm falling<br>
The power is there<br>
I pray as I'm falling<br>
The power is there<br>
<br>
I'm not who I was<br>
(Who I was)<br>
And I wish I was a better man<br>
But I am who I am<br>
(Who I am)<br>
I crawl from the dust<br>
(From the dust)<br>
And I've never seemed to understand<br>
But this is who I am<br>
(Who I am)
