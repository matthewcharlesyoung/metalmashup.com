      <p class="lyrics-test-test">Something stirs from an aeon ago<br>
in the centre of a circle of cyclopean stones<br>
Incantations from a mucus bound tome<br>
as the cult makes preparations for their lord's welcome home<br>
chanting dark and cacophonous rhymes<br>
while the thunder and lightning rends a hole in the sky<br>
rising tendrils of ash now encircle the sun<br>
turning black from the blast of the Greatfather's drum<br>
<br>
For there can be only one..<br>
<br>
There's a pulsating heart in the midst of the void<br>
Twisted maladous melodies which create and destroy<br>
through a ritual of blood in a valley of doom<br>
he assumes human form on an altar of shrooms<br>
Expulsion of the outcast mind<br>
Cursed to wander in the gardens of slish for all time<br>
For this book is the key, and the psyche; a door<br>
to a cosmic cornucopia of esoteric lore<br>
<br>
Cursed words, scribed in slime<br>
Spoken in reverse when the stars are aligned<br>
Only under the black sun, may these mortals partake in his conjuration<br>
Trapped in a spell of the Gastronomicon..<br>
<br>
And beneath the shattered sky the earth will grieve<br>
except for man, who shall be granted no reprieve<br>
On this land which once gave life, now lies clear<br>
In the poisoned depths the wreckage of ten thousand years<br>
<br>
Blasphemers of true nature<br>
Hiding from the inner self<br>
virtues that don't exist<br>
deny genetic heritage<br>
<br>
the circle is complete<br>
We must return to the earth<br>
<br>
Usurpers of your masters<br>
You have become mere facades<br>
Nought but pale reflections<br>
A species in dejection<br>

Fixated and strangulated<br>
this twisted seed, a bastard breed<br>
Sewn for surplus<br>
Sustaining domination through extraction<br>
a policy of scorched earth, imitating wilderness<br>
<br>
In disgust we have judged the propagator of this disease<br>
Life undone, a broken trust, they've made a desert and called it peace<br>
<br>
Strangling hold, so called fields of gold<br>
as far as the eyes can see<br>
What you call life, I call blight, and it must end<br>
For earth to breathe<br>
<br>
Poisonous streams<br>
bathed in tears, cascade into an airless void<br>
Faded and irradiated<br>

Desalinated, a fool's gambit<br>
Their last defense is now removed<br>
The slow march of death begins<br>
This silence heralds the coming of their doom<br>
<br>
Trapped in a spiral of supply and demand<br>
Feeding new mouths to in time work this land<br>
at the crack of the whip they will dance to the tune<br>
of the lies made by the madmen who extract and consume<br>
<br>
Whose tombs are lined with their gold yet are buried in the sludge<br>
of a hewn and exploited world.<br>
<br>
Dark below where no light lies, shifting under iron hides<br>
final bastion of the deep, taken to extremes<br>

Haunted through the heart of darkness<br>
by horrors unknown<br>
A nightmare that never subsides<br>
wading through wastelands of bone.<br>

Sojourn in galleries of anguish searching for wisdom's elusive pearl<br>
lost in a lonesome city, witness the last gasp of a dying world<br>

reclaiming the earth from the stone<br>

The rancour in it's construction outlived it's architects<br>
Labyrinthine and monolithic, hallowed hall of the dead<br>

City of shades, a pale reflection of it's past glory<br>
where the dead ever roam in the crumbling halls<br>
now entombed by their greed delving far too deep<br>
down where fiends never sleep and the light can't reach<br>
<br>
twisted creatures rend and flay, draped in skins in their sick masquerade<br>
flesh stripped victims to discard, butchered for amusement in this cursed abattoir<br>

where hope is exiguous, all are prone to despair<br>

Domestic animals lost without the trappings of their civilization<br>
You like to play armchair eugenicist, militant pessimist<br>
An ivory tower that's built upon<br>
the product of a million labors<br>
<br>
Regression to the mean, repression of the weak<br>
fraudulent pyramid scheme of human hierarchy<br>
<br>
Do you ever wonder why you've been deprived<br>
the wealth of nations?<br>
do you feel the trickle down your leg?<br>
Preoccupied with war against your own and your own home<br>
How is it you're not already dead?<br><br>
Another failed experiment<br>
Evidence suggests you will not pass the last great filter<br>
The soldiers won't defend the hive<br>
when the queen neglects to satisfy the builders<br>
You like to play the devil's advocate, passive and impotent<br>
brood over fallen empires<br>
That were built upon the bones of millions<br>
<br>
Narrow minded sanctimonious<br>
self-serving sophistry<br>
Greed governing holiness?<br>
Not in the version I have seen.<br>
<br>
You will not see the stars<br>
doomed to the tides<br>
access denied, fated to die</p>

          <h1 id="t3" class="lyrics-test">-The Spectral Burrows-</h1>
          <p class="lyrics-test-test">Lost in a churning mindless fulmination<br>
Devoid of a reason or explanation<br>
a chorus of voices become a roaring cacophony<br>
assaulting our senses as they sleep<br>
<br>
putrid beings within, no better, or worse<br>
each one scrambling for a ladder<br>
death becomes us, that which we adore<br>
long lost innocence<br>
<br>
In these slime-ridden kingdoms where we wallow<br>
free from the pity, disgust and sorrow<br>
far from where light can pierce<br>
drowned by the fetid bog<br>
beyond the graces of your god<br>
<br>
Sink in, inhale the ichor<br>
why not assume your true form?<br>
Join with us this is our blessing<br>
unified as one forever<br>
biologically entwined<br>
Together until the end time.<br>
<br>
hideous depravity lurks beneath the mask of civility<br>
<br>
Look to your heathen master for his coming<br>
We shall obey him and speak of nothing<br>
Mentor of pain and suffering<br>
the spawn of the sentient ooze<br>
Soon you will drown within him too<br>
<br>
in the name of the greatfather, worship him and no other<br>
Bestow upon us the sigil, arise from your silent ritual</p>

          <h1 id="t4" class="lyrics-test">-Slave Goo World-</h1>
          <p class="lyrics-test-test">Stygian minions of esteemed erudition<br>
bear witness to the most abject human condition<br>
staunch technicians of decomposition<br>
breathing life into the lifeless animating his vision<br>
all partake in occult calibration<br>
realigning the ley-slime for the dark invocation<br>
sing on high to the lords long unspoken<br>
Reborn into the world through the minds of his chosen<br>
<br>
Psychic virus from the vast outer reaches<br>
marks the grand unification of science and religion<br>
In the name of our brethren; the molluscs<br>
lesser lifeforms prostrate before the horror of horrors<br>
terrible vistas of a nihilistic future<br>
the old cthonic scriptures; the new jurisprudence<br>
to usher an era of grand cosmic culture<br>
all nations and worlds under the sign of mollusca<br>
<br>
Submit your soul, for it's no use to you where you go<br>
Beyond the passage of time<br>
Embrace the void in which all things were made and destroyed<br>
we shall be one in his mind<br>
<br>
Praise be the name of the dark incarnate<br>
Great beast of the all-in-one<br>
First of the gods from the formless chaos<br>
Kindling the flame of the suns<br>
<br>
His children most resplendent and pure<br>
shall inherit the order of worlds<br>
From the lowest dominion unto the mucus throne<br>
that this kingdom might ever endure<br>
<br>
cast off the flesh become one with the ooze<br>
and through the god-mind what's broken is renewed</p>

          <p class="lyrics-test-test">Airborne pathogens<br>
a contorting carcinoma multiplies without end<br>
invasive genophagia, irreversible damage<br>
dismantling and reassembling their nucleic acid<br>
<br>
shambling eldritch beast, a mindless vector of disease<br>
the brain erodes, flesh calcifies, controlled by endoparasites<br>
Your mind and body are not your own, play host to hostile lifeforms<br>
Unseen, explosive haze, with every breath you become their slave<br>
<br>
This world was never yours to begin with<br>
and nor will it be in the end<br>
<br>
As you devour, so shall you be<br>
this plague never replete<br>
Against this foe there is no victory<br>
self-destruction written in the genes<br>
<br>
The wilderness reclaims these empty streets<br>
history is forgotten<br>
once thriving metropolises now mortuaries<br>
derelict, old and rotten<br>
<br>
Their cradle is our grave, new life born of decay<br>
<br>
We prosper from their ruin<br>
As our progeny lament, we will not be forgiven<br>
The storm on the horizon writes their names in the sky<br>
as we gamble the future on the roll of a dice

          <h1 id="t6" class="lyrics-test">-Putrid Fairytale-</h1>
          <p class="lyrics-test-test">Corrupt ignobility adorned in pilfered gold<br>
conceived in sewage by insipid lords of old<br>
inbred degenerates languish in squalid halls<br>
impotent and superfluous, unable to uphold<br>
<br>
the basic tenets of the creed<br>
usurpers vie to supersede<br>
a tired waning hegemony, long bereft of majesty<br>
<br>
Self-righteous justiciars desire to purify<br>
a world of lies, that seeks to purge the earth and sky<br>
licentious seditionists; gorge as your planet burns<br>
from slime they came, and into slime they shall return<br>
<br>
Praise the primordial poison pools that gave us form<br>
to defy his decree, they dare to bite the hand that feeds<br>
<br>
The custodians have become the abuser<br>
ignorant beings with arrogant ideas<br>
<br>
They loose a hail of arrows<br>
that scorch the eyes of all who gaze<br>
but it won't save them from the hell that waits<br>
<br>
Mythologized transcendence, a paradise is lost<br>
No deliverance from the dire cost<br>
<br>
They've chosen the form of the destructor<br>
More of slime than blood<br>
their planet torn asunder by plutonium<br>
<br>
Mercury rising, the surface scorched<br>
They descend like rats into the bowels of earth<br>
<br>
Digging like roaches through a mire<br>
of their own self indulgence<br>
caught in a web of fate<br>
too bloodless to escape<br>
<br>
No god can save you now<br>
for they have no power here<br>
within these ashen crypts<br>
of suffering and despair<br>
<br>
the flame ignited in it's heart<br>
a chain reaction tearing apart<br>
reaching the critical mass<br>
The weapon of their futile vengeance<br>
<br>
The eye, ablaze with radiance<br>
that sears against your flesh<br>
Dread rumbling in the deep<br>
signalling the impending death<br>
<br>
blinded by a caustic storm<br>
the slamming of cyclopean doors<br>
held aloft the orb ignites<br>
Nowhere to run now from the light<br>
<br>
Now standing in the presence of a foe conceived by alien gods<br>
Never again to feel the sun, it immolates you<br>
The Life-age of the universe, a wind that sweeps the world away<br>
you feel the weight of every world bearing down on you</p>

          <p class="lyrics-test-test">Speak to darkness in your lowest ebb;<br>
only silence<br>
there's no future, only past regrets<br>
meditate on them<br>
<br>
suspended in infinite blackness<br>
so numb, agony is no distraction<br>
contempt for life replacing sadness<br>
<br>
Is this clarity or madness?<br>
temporary energy and matter<br>
the will to live is irrevocably damaged<br>
<br>
a listless spirit wants to leave the world<br>
sweet oblivion<br>
vital essence grinding to a halt<br>
we are all at fault<br>
<br>
falling from the creaking rafters<br>
pressure, so much worse than you imagined<br>
burning, death's umbilica unravels<br>
<br>
drifting from his sweet embrace<br>
gasping for breath, staring in the grave<br>
only fear, as what little light left fades<br>
<br>
And on the pedestal, these words appear<br>
"Look on my works ye mighty, and despair!"<br>
<br>
Negated by the unbearable truth<br>
all-consuming psychotic fugue<br>
fall to a lightless self-destructive end<br>
for there is a monster in the heart of all men<br>
<br>
Hearken to nightmares of futility enshrined<br>
in sleepless terrors born of the mind<br>
and upon the horizon of the waking world<br>
time stands still.<br>
<br>
Damnation is our destiny<br>
existence is disease<br>
Our screams are the music of reality<br>
<br>
Relinquish all your earthly bonds<br>
and bow before the god of madness<br>
let him untether you from pain<br>
step outside the circle and be saved<br>
<br>
Crippled by the triviality, the insanity of existing<br>
A mockery; this master plan, crushed by the hand of fate<br>
<br>
No solace in this hopeless cycle<br>
at one with fear and the darkness<br>
Attain mastery over shadow<br>
purge trepidation from your heart<br>
<br>
Your adversary is within, these mental chains are your prison<br>
malignant love of your projected self; a toxic delusion<br>
<br>
Chaos, decay, withering away<br>
the sense of self, starting to fade</p>

within their sanctuary of salt and sorrow<br>

Morbid throngs march to the call of umbral gods<br>
outside comprehension<br>

Dark crusade, from deathless realm they came<br>
to amalgamate dimensions<br>

Tainted youth, catechized legions of untruth<br>

Now ensnared by the web of their deceit<br>
acquiescent, servile, weak<br>

This ritual of loathsome conjuration<br>
akashic machinations from shadow priests who utter<br>
the gathas of mollusca<br>
that poisons our existence<br>
between purity and putrescence they draw power<br>

The bloodshed of the ancestors<br>
Forsaken dead<br>
Sacrificed so the worlds might mend<br>
all filaments have opened<br>
the shadows bleed<br>
infinity spewing forth from the gaping breach<br>
<br>
We shall dredge the depths of their pestiferous swamp<br>
and the last bastion of light shall fall into ruin<br>
<br>
Once besieged, the walls shall liquefy beneath<br>
the force of Rhaexorog's harrowing screams<br>
<br>
Twin blasphemies; Kak and Ick shall come together<br>
to rouse their father from the nether</p>

Yet in an effort to move away from the more mainstream aspects of our scene, Metal Mashup has a much-needed focus on the more underground achievements of our community. Don’t get us wrong though, while we all love a bit of Metallica and still lose our shit every time Hetfield sneezes or Lars manages to keep time, we just feel that there is more to our clan that needs to be celebrated.</p>
