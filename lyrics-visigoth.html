      <p class="lyrics-test-test">Out across the foothills they rode<br>
Banners as black as their souls<br>
As a winter sky loomed above<br>
Pale as the wind-driven snow<br>
I have seen this day in my dreams<br>
The hour of my doom drawing nigh<br>
<br>
Black blades of treachery draw forth my aging blood<br>
And I fall, dying on the cold stones of my throne<br>
<br>
Retake the usurper's throne<br>
The blades of our fallen burst forth with the revenant's breath<br>
Destined to fight, even in death<br>
These are the bones that they thought they had shattered<br>
But we'll never rest<br>
<br>
Immortal blood courses through my veins<br>
I won't be denied; your battle's lost in vain<br>
I have returned to reclaim my rightful throne<br>
From realms beyond the waking world<br>
We'll rend your flesh from bone<br>
<br>
There the young man sits on my throne<br>
Surrounded by ill-gotten gains<br>
Ebon hair and eyes black like coal<br>
Murder and thievery his way<br>
I see the horror gripping his mind<br>
As we descend on his ranks<br>
<br>
A thousand men they thought they had killed ride out from the woods<br>
And our steel thirsts for betrayers' flesh and blood<br>
<br>
Retake the usurper's throne<br>
The blades of our fallen burst forth with the revenant's breath<br>
Destined to fight, even in death<br>
These are the bones that they thought they had shattered<br>
But we'll never rest<br>
<br>
Immortal blood courses through my veins<br>
I won't be denied; your battle's lost in vain<br>
I have returned to reclaim my rightful throne<br>
From realms beyond the waking world<br>
We'll rend your flesh from bone<br>
<br>
We traveled realms beyond the crystal moon<br>
And shadowed keeps<br>
Where mighty serpents stalked ensorcelled seas<br>
And ice-crowned peaks<br>
So here we are to bring your end my friend<br>
And none shall week<br>
Betrayal's debt paid in your foul blood<br>
The price is steep<br>
<br>
We are revenant<br>
We have returned<br>
So bow your heads<br>
We are your doom<br>
<br>
The hoarfrost breaks as steel-shod hooves<br>
Make known their presence to the night<br>
And fires rise against the starwheel, casting smoke into the sky<br>
My bloodline was and always will be rightful heirs to this old throne<br>
Your blood will slake the soil's thirst for sacrifice and blooded stone<br>
<br>
Immortal blood courses through my veins<br>
I won't be denied; your battle's lost in vain<br>
I have returned to reclaim my rightful throne<br>
From realms beyond the waking world<br>
We'll rend your flesh from bone</p>

Dark horizons black will rumble with the voice of prophecy<br>
We are standing steadfast against a gathering dark<br>

Take a chance, roll the dice<br>
Is this hell or paradise?<br>

He's the dungeon master<br>
<br>
Master of evil, lord of the dark<br>
In catacombs and blackened tomes is where is foul will is wrought<br>
But on the field of battle, see our legions ride<br>
Thunderous hooves like raging storms will sound across the azure sky<br>

<br>
We've traveled long, we've traveled far<br>
With shining steel and morningstar<br>
We call upon the gods of old<br>
In ancient texts it was foretold<br>
<br>
We are the legions who will ride into the dawn<br>
The war will take its toll but we will carry on<br>
So raise your banners to the sky and let us hear your battlecries<br>
Now let the horns resound and call for victory<br>
The hordes advance but we are fierce and we are free<br>
So loose your arrows to the sky and raise your magick steel on high<br>
<br>
We are the pathfinders, we are the travelers<br>
We are the voices of steel in the night<br>
We are the warriors, we are the sorcerers<br>
And our magicks will light up the sky<br>
<br>
Take a chance, roll the dice<br>
Is this hell or paradise?<br>
In this land of high adventure carve your fate<br>
Forgotten realms, magick spells<br>
Hallowed halls beneath the fells<br>
He's the master of the evil in deep<br>

He's the dungeon master</p>

Hail! From the wastes of they North he rides<br>
Hail! Crushing the earth with every stride<br>
<br>
Tale of blood and might<br>
Mammoth rider through the night<br>
Ancient warrior<br>
The spear of destiny<br>
Eyes full of hate<br>
Gored upon the tusks of fate<br>
Fight against the gods<br>
The mammoth rider comes<br>
<br>
Armed with a spear whose blade was forged from meteors<br>
Tempered in the blood of a thousand conquerors<br>
Heart filled with hatred for the murder of his tribe<br>
Against the sorcerer the mammoth warrior rides<br>
<br>
Hail! From the wastes of they North he rides<br>
Hail! Pounds at the earth like a battle-drum<br>

"Your feeble flesh bends to my will!<br>
I've seen your future in my crystal ball<br>
Your beast of war won't save your skin<br>
In shrouded magicks I've forseen your fall<br>
Your end is nigh!"<br>
<br>

He rides out from the mountains with vengeance in his eyes<br>
Across the rivers and valleys to where the ocean meets the skies<br>
Against th sorcerer's army he raises his spear and shield<br>
And calls upon his people's gods to bring him victory on the battlefield<br>
<br>
And he rides to meet his fate<br>
<br>
Evil magicks rend the sky<br>
Bow to the wizard<br>
Ancient, twisted necromancy<br>
Spells of death<br>

Tale of blood and might<br>
Mammoth rider through the night<br>

      <p class="lyrics-test-test">The late October moon rises through the fog<br>
Alabaster witness to the rite<br>
Hooded figures bowed deep within the trees<br>
Thirteen gathered for the sacrifice<br>
<br>
Deep in the forest thirteen hooded figures stand<br>
The hour of the ritual is now at hand<br>
They've gathered for the sacrifice<br>
A gnarled hand extends above the altar stone<br>
An incantation rises from its hoary throat<br>
A spell invoked to claim the night<br>
<br>
Incantation, evil magick rise<br>
<br>
Blood sacrifice, an ancient rite<br>
Blood sacrifice upon the altar stone<br>
Blood sacrifice, an ancient rite<br>
Blood sacrifice unto the pentagram<br>
<br>
The pale moon bathes the virgin's skin in pallid light<br>
Entranced by verses tolled from forms deep in the night<br>
Her final breath is drawn in blood<br>
As crimson creeps across the cracked and ancient stone<br>
Five-pointed star ignites and belches forth black smoke<br>
Demonic forces summoned forth<br>
<br>
Incantation, evil magick rise<br>
<br>
Blood sacrifice, an ancient rite<br>
Blood sacrifice upon the altar stone<br>
Blood sacrifice, an ancient rite<br>
Blood sacrifice unto the pentagram<br>
<br>
With human offal offering, we gaze into the great abyss<br>
We summon thee, oh antichrist<br>
This virgin's blood so red and pure will bind your will unto our own<br>
Bow before the horned god<br>
<br>

Rise on wings as black as night<br>
Summoned by the sacrifice<br>
Chaos reigns and death is come<br>
Twisted horns eclipse the sun<br>
<br>
The late October sky streaked with blood and fire<br>
Yawning gateway to the underworld<br>
From the altar the young girl rises with cold black haunted eyes<br>
Chosen queen of a brimstone kingdom come<br>
The reborn empress of hell<br>

<br>
Incantation, evil magick rise<br>
<br>
Blood sacrifice, an ancient rite<br>
Blood sacrifice upon the altar stone<br>

I've journeyed long and far this day<br>
Lurking shadows in the parapets<br>
Will never make me turn away<br>
Darkened city veiled in crimson mist<br>
Entombed in time without decay<br>
Never thought it would be like this<br>
It feels like I'm living inside a dream<br>
But my mind tells me I'm<br>
<br>
Lost in Necropolis, lost in Necropolis<br>
Lost in Necropolis, lost in Necropolis<br>

Now I know what it's like to be<br>
Inside the city of the dead<br>
All I think of is breaking free<br>
From all the spells chained to my head<br>
Sword and axe are my destiny<br>
I watch the stars turning blood red<br>
There is light yes I've got to believe<br>
For this feels like living inside a dream<br>
I know now that I am<br>

Lost in Necropolis, lost in Necropolis<br>
Lost in Necropolis, lost in Necropolis<br>

I have seen your cities burning<br>
I have felt your daughters yearning<br>
For the peace before the tides of war<br>
I have witnessed funeral pyres<br>
Burning bright with man's desire<br>
I will fight the demon horde forever more<br>
<br>
The world is full of mysteries<br>
That men have never seen before<br>
Magik lives in all dynasties<br>
The light of love shines ever more<br>
In the crypts of Atlantean Kings<br>
I found what I was looking for<br>
Magik Trident of Volusia's Sea<br>
I know it's like living inside a dream<br>
But don't you ever get<br>

From the south they came with iron and fire<br>
I take my father's blade and shield into my vengeful hands<br>
I won't lay down my sword until they've all been slain<br>
From the north I will come with cold, hateful judgment<br>

This tale of vengeance will be told<br>
As written in the blood of my foes<br>
This tale of vengeance will unfold<br>
Before the night is done they will fall<br>

The blood upon my hands avenges all that I have lost<br>
But sill the battle-rage is coursing through my veins<br>
From the south they came with iron and fire<br>
I stand victorious above the final treacherous dog<br>
The world becomes an empty shell now as he dies<br>

She is here and we'll set the world ablaze<br>

      <p class="lyrics-test-test">Seven suns light the sky<br>
Our time has come, at last we ride<br>
<br>
In days when arcane magicks ripped apart the ancient sky<br>
And mighty tyrants ruled with sorcery and steel<br>
Where vast barbaric hordes rode out on cursed battlefields<br>
And spilled each others' blood with chaos in their hearts<br>
<br>
Seven suns shall rise in an endless desert sky<br>
<br>
Across these ancient paths we ride<br>
We feel a sorrow deep inside<br>
Reclaim the fire in our minds<br>
And raise our fists against the sky<br>
<br>
The hourglass proclaims the death of ages come to pass<br>
Forgotten sagas fade to grey mythology<br>
Now steel and honor and usurped by cold complacency<br>
And battles born within the vile womb of avarice<br>
<br>
Seven suns shall rise in an endless desert sky<br>
<br>
So from the depths of ancient ages, beneath the sun-scorched sand<br>
An evil with no name awaits to claim the land again<br>
And so we wait with bated breath for the rising of the seventh sun<br>
To break the chains of our entombment<br>
The dawn of battle comes<br>
<br>
Beyond these walls of sand and time, bells of destiny shall chime<br>
Out of the arcane mists of prophecy the guardians will rise<br>
From an age of sword and shield and distant war-torn battlefield<br>
We have returned to serve this dying realm with sorcery and steel<br>
<br>

Across these ancient paths we ride<br>
We feel a sorrow deep inside<br>
Reclaim the fire in our minds<br>
And raise our fists against the sky<br>
<br>
All that once was, all you believed was owed to you<br>
Has been shattered and destroyed and now at last you understand<br>
Your redemption has come at a cost and we won't weep for what you've lost<br>
So as our words fade into the star-filled sky<br>
You must repent, you must reclaim</p>

        <h1 id="s5" class="lyrics-test">-Traitor's Gate-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Cold is the crown of death<br>
Fear in its chilling brath<br>
Howls like wraiths upon the wind<br>
<br>
Watch with weeping eyes<br>
Flames on a bleeding sky<br>
I have seen true betrayal<br>
<br>
Sorrow fills my soul<br>
Reforged by the cold flames of hate<br>
Past the point off no return<br>
<br>
Vengeance guide my hand<br>
Brothersno more, in single combat we stand<br>
So draw your final breath<br>
Bitter is the end<br>
<br>
Fly throug the traitors' gate<br>
I am the reaver that rides on the cold winds of hate<br>
So fear my return<br>
<br>
Stars, be my blazing guide<br>
Lighting my way like torches that murders the night<br>
Fear my return<br>
<br>
Betrayer, deceiver<br>
My words are a sword of cleandsing flame<br>
Betrayer, deceiver<br>
I vomit a course upon your name<br>
<br>
Open the Traitors' Gate<br>
So fear my return, I am the hammer of fate<br>
<br>
Blood like a ruby curse<br>
Stabwounds ensconced in my spine like a diadem's jewels<br>
Dread crown upon my brow<br>
<br>
Die now like the dog you are<br>
Slain by my hand but the doing was no-one's but yours<br>
I am the face aof all that you've done<br>
<br>
Betrayer, deceiver<br>
My words are a sword of cleandsing flame<br>
Betrayer, deceiver<br>
I vomit a course upon your name<br>
<br>
Open the Traitor's Gate<br>
So fear my return, I am the hammer of fate<br>
<br>
By spite and thunder<br>
Torn asunder<br>
No tomorrow<br>
Now that I've seen what you are I can only bring<br>
Spite and thunder<br>
Feral hunter<br>
Death shall stalk you<br>
No mercy lefft in my heart and I'll never back down<br>
<br>
Silent I stand, grim as the winter night's jaws<br>
Thus I descend, ironclad in my resolve<br>
So make your peace<br>
With every god that abandoned you on your last night<br>
Reap now what you've sown<br>
I am the scythe, I am the revenant blade<br>
Weep now, welcome death<br>
<br>

Betrayer, deceiver<br>
My words are a sword of cleandsing flame<br>
Betrayer, deceiver<br>
I vomit a course upon your name<br>
<br>
Open the Traitor's Gate<br>
So fear my return, I am the hammer of fate<br>
<br>
Die, traitor, die<br>
Look me in the eye<br>
Die, coward, die<br>
As I take your life</p>

        <p class="lyrics-test-test">Shadows are banished form the<br>
Darkened thrones they took above our valley city<br>
Slain by a shimmering midnight dawn of neon lights<br>
Revel in the warmth of summer nights<br>
Don't think of sorrows that we left behind<br>
We it the sidewalk and we hold our heads up high<br>
<br>
Salt City livin', this is the place that we call home<br>
Salt City livin', we ride beneath the mountain thrones<br>
Salt City livin', this towen is ours to take tonight<br>
Salt City livin', we won't rest until the morning's light<br>
<br>
Now driving high across the 80<br>
I can see beyond the setting sun<br>
The city lights below a sea of burning stars<br>
So grab a Wasatch, knock it back<br>
And don't forget to grab a few for us<br>
The night is young and so are we and that's enough<br>
<br>
Salt City livin', this is the place that we call home<br>
Salt City livin', we ride beneath the mountain thrones<br>
Salt City livin', this towen is ours to take tonight<br>
Salt City livin', we won't rest until the morning's light<br>
<br>
Salt City livin', this is the place that we call home<br>
Salt City livin', we ride beneath the mountain thrones<br>
Salt City livin', this towen is ours to take tonight<br>
Salt City livin', we won't rest until the morning's light</p>

        <h1 id="s7" class="lyrics-test">-Blades in the Night-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test">I did not choose this life but here I stand<br>
With temperd steel I will repay their betrayals this night<br>
Into the reaches of the shadowland<br>
With demon-fire burning deep in my heart I will fight<br>
<br>
Fom darkness I rise, a wraith in the black<br>
In cover of night, prepare for attack<br>
<br>
Blades in the night<br>
The darkness I ride, in the shadows I fight<br>
Blades in the night<br>
The darkness I ride, in the shadows I fight<br>
<br>

I'm never seen unless I wish to be<br>
So fear the twilightfall for I am the fist of the moon<br>
I have no time to dwell on sorrows now<br>
This is my path, by fury cursed<br>
And by vengeance consumed<br>
<br>
From darkness I rise, a wraith in the black<br>
In cover of night, prepare for attack<br>
<br>
Blades in the night<br>
The darkness I ride, in the shadows I fight<br>
Blades in the night<br>
The darkness I ride, in the shadows I fight<br>
<br>
I am the razor wind that whispers through the trees<br>
With this ancestral blad, I'll conquer any foe<br>
My vengeance will be swift and silent, my judgement deft<br>
<br>
From darkness I rise, a wraith in the black<br>
In cover of night, prepare for attack<br>
<br>
Blades in the night<br>
The darkness I ride, in the shadows I fight<br>
Blades in the night<br>
The darkness I irde, in the shadows I fight</p>

        <h1 id="s8" class="lyrics-test">-The Conqueror's Oath-</h1>
        <p class="lyrics-test-test"> 	Do you ever feel<br>
That your life was meant to be so much more<br>
As if your soul is lost and far from home<br>
Dashed like a wayward ship<br>
An the rocks of a distant shore<br>
<br>
Be still our hearts<br>
And come the flood<br>
Sing through our souls<br>
Like thunder and blood<br>
<br>
Stand and swear the conqueror's oath<br>
May your name and deeds live on<br>
Stand and swear the conqueror's oath<br>
Let the ancient fire burn<br>
<br>
Are you content<br>
With the life that you lead<br>
Or does a yearning for glory and conquest<br>
Haunt you in fitful sleep<br>
<br>
Nothing will change<br>
If you don't take up your arms<br>
And ride unfettered into the unknown<br>
With pride in your heart<br>
<br>
Be still our hearts<br>
And come the flood<br>
Sing through our souls<br>
Like thunder and blood<br>
<br>
Thrones on the mountains calling your name<br>
Thundering hammers forging you fate<br>
Cut your own path to victory's gates<br>
Never let go of the flame<br>
Purpose nd passion, metal and might<br>
Out of the darkness, into the light<br>
Never again will despair take your life<br>
Ride with fire, conquering the night<br>
<br>
Aging warrior, looking back at the life that you've led<br>
Can you say with confidence that you would do it again?<br>
For one day you'll be gone, and all that lives on<br>
Is the honour of thy name and the deeds that you've done<br>
<br>
Be still our hearts<br>
And come the flood<br>
Sing through our souls<br>
Like thunder and blood</p>
