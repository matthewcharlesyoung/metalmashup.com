<br>
I've been taken away on a journey with no path<br>
Struggled to overcome broken bones of the past<br>
Chased glory on strangers seas<br>
Became everything you all need<br>
<br>
I have been a toy in the hands of the universe<br>
So many times left unnoticed<br>
I have been a toy in the hands of the universe<br>
So many times left unnoticed<br>
<br>
You are all a broken reflection<br>
Of what you expect the world to see<br>
After all you are everything<br>
You want each other to believe<br>
To believe<br>
<br>
And I am everything<br>
You all will eventually need<br>
I sold my soul<br>
In trade of a greater will<br>
To show you all<br>
I will be the only one standing still<br>
<br>
I have been a toy in the hands of the universe<br>
So many times left unnoticed<br>
I have been a toy in the hands of the universe<br>
So many times left unnoticed<br>
<br>
You are all a broken reflection<br>
Of what you expect the world to see<br>
After all you are everything<br>
You want each other to believe<br>
<br>
The world has no chance<br>
For this is the end<br>
Success will be my revenge<br>
Revenge<br>
<br>
From this revenge I feed<br>
And I won't rest<br>
Until this fucking planet is renamed after me<br>
<br>
You've been taken away on a journey with no path<br>
Struggled to overcome broken bones of the past<br>
Chased glory on strangers seas<br>
Destroying yourselves thinking you could destroy me</p>

      <p class="lyrics-test-test">I've noticed that every single one of you<br>
Suffer from the same disease<br>
I am the answer<br>
I am the one you need<br>
<br>
Perfect illustration<br>
Of the god you praise<br>
But I possess the power to destroy your race<br>
<br>
Stop your useless struggle<br>
You have fallen from the abyss of your faith<br>
You can't deny rejection, by the one you praise<br>
<br>
I am, greatness wanted, but never achieved<br>
I am death, the only one you all seek<br>
Fear me, I am the god of destruction<br>
I am the messenger of death, I am the only, the decider<br>
<br>
The agglutination of the king<br>
Gives powers to his consort<br>
Her powers are now ever lasting<br>
Creation of Destruction<br>
<br>
No matter what secrets you possess<br>
No matter what fears you hold, what darkness you hide<br>
There are others like you<br>
<br>
Fear me, I am the god of destruction<br>
I am the messenger of death, I am the only, the decider<br>

I am the decider, the one that makes you pray<br>
I am the decider, the one that sets your fucking faith</p>

These doors close<br>

Thinking the dead is the enemy<br>
The Enemy<br>
<br>
To know what's in here<br>
I must continue searching the answers, within<br>

I'm Insane<br>

These noises can't be real<br>
The lies my life will steal<br>
How can I believe if I'm actually blind<br>
These noises can't be real<br>
The lies my life will steal<br>
Can I please just ask to survive?<br>

The dead will rise<br>
They know exactly what I<br>
Can't find inside<br>
My reality isn't real<br>

The curtains fall<br>
My answers lie outside<br>
The curtains fall<br>
I've been my own true lie<br>

How couldn't I see<br>
I'm the haunting one FUCK<br>

They know exactly what I<br>

They know exactly what I<br>
Can't find inside<br>
Now I know<br>
<br>
Everything seems clear now<br>
That I can see that I have too been the lifeless<br>
How have I been so blind to see that<br>
The souls I've searched were real<br>
The souls I've searched were fucking haunted<br>
By my own nonexistence<br>
I was haunted by the living<br>
When I'm actually<br>
(No one can make us leave) DEAD</p>

And when the sun falls I crave this strength to be<br>
As big as the passion I reflect with hate<br>
As big as the intention to change my own fate<br>
<br>
Never more shall I regret the day<br>
That failure would stand on my way<br>
Not now, nor even if it's too late<br>
There's nothing keeping me astray<br>
Nothing will stand on my way<br>
Not now, nor even if it's too late<br>
<br>
I regret nothing<br>
I regret nothing<br>

(If) I've lived a life full of deception<br>

(Else) No goals have been conquered<br>
The algorithm of life, why we suffer<br>

(If) I've lived a life full of deception<br>
(Then) The only change was perception<br>

This is our decoding, why we perish<br>
This is why we suffer, my reckoning<br>

I'll use this pain to my own advantage<br>
I'll stop the sun from burning, this planet from spinning<br>

      <p class="lyrics-test-test">I've lived my whole life believing that the sun<br>
Would shine everyday on top of what I praised the most<br>
But still the strain I've felt ever since<br>
Leaves me sleepless, fearing the day that I'm lost<br>
Fearing the day that we're set apart<br>
<br>
I'd prefer to live in nothingness for<br>
All eternity<br>
I'd prefer to take my own life away<br>
<br>
Than to exist in a world without a creator<br>
<br>
No escape for humanity's routine<br>
Tears my spine in two, makes me feel weak<br>
No escape for humanity's routine<br>
Tears my spine in two, makes me feel..<br>
<br>
Like it's the easy work of the seer<br>
There's nothing holding me here<br>
Like eternal sorrow is here to stay<br>
Am I the only one going insane?<br>
<br>
This is the ephemeral order<br>
<br>
I ask forbearance please<br>
Suspended disbelief<br>
Imagine minds floating<br>
The darkness of time<br>
I'm truly committed to save what's rightfully mine<br>
<br>
I call the speakers of the dead, come to me!<br>
Come forth mother goddess<br>
<br>
"I call forth the speakers of the dead<br>
Feed off my soul<br>
Bring eternal life to my creator<br>
Feed Off my fucking existence<br>
Please.."<br>
