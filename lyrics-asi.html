But how can I call it unfaithful<br>
Every promise was fulfilled<br>
As decay crawled from it's throat<br>
Like the dead rising from an open grave<br>
Lips of splendor and tongue of deceit<br>
All dying now as our fragile wrists hold only waste<br><br>

Like those gasping for their last breath<br>
We cannot hide there's nothing left<br><br>

If All my sorrow has led me here<br>
Then I would cry all of my tears<br>
To have this chance again<br>
And know there's more than this<br>

while my thoughts ran to the hills<br>
my heart never reached the sea<br>
with only delusions of an endless journey<br>
I am left with an ocean between you and me<br><br>

Is this your salvation?<br>
Is this all you can give?<br>
I will not stand in reflection<br>

The gate to my heart has been weld shut<br>

We are alone and afraid<br><br>

I know you are the one we left behind<br>
Yet somehow we are the ones who are alone<br>
you are the one we left behind<br>
you are the one we left be...<br><br>

I will no longer turn my head<br>
I will never forget you<br>
You are the one we left behind<br>
You are the forsaken<br><br>

We've built our confidence<br>
On broken dreams now left for dead<br>
Yet we've been condemned<br>
To chase these dreams that never end<br><br>

I know you are the one we left behind<br>
Yet somehow we are the ones who are alone<br>
you are the one we left behind<br>
you are the one we left be...<br><br>

I will no longer turn my head<br>

You are the one we left behind<br>

I will no longer turn my head<br>
I will never forget you<br>

Until the whole world is not enough<br>
Forgive the day that I erased your name<br>
that I erased your name<br>
For it's the memory of me that will decay<br><br>

As I nearly destroyed myself<br>
Never had I felt so betrayed<br>
That you would sacrifice my life<br>
For no more than comfort<br>
And now your love means nothing to me<br><br>
You are a coward, the antithesis of a friend<br>
Take action before there is<br>
No one left to defend<br>
For I would have stood by you<br>
Right to the gates of hell

And I never cared before<br>
Now take it all back<br>
This is a new day<br><br>

How I long to regress<br>
To the days before I took upon myself<br>
The obsessions of this world<br>
A day of innocence equating beauty<br>
For tomorrow may fall<br>
And today is already gone<br><br>

Now take it back<br>
This is a new day<br><br>

I've grown tired of chasing<br>
Convinced I was in need<br>
And now the years I've spent<br>
Only a slave to this<br>
Tomorrow may fall<br>
And today is already gone<br>
I will no longer adore<br>
These things that will never satisfy me<br><br>

I have seen my world change<br>
And then go back to where it came<br>
In this vicious circle<br>
We are all brought back to life<br>
Only to die again<br>
But without these barren obsessions<br>
I am simply free

      <p class="lyrics-test-test">I see them coming<br>
With shrouds to bury us all<br>
Before we were born they shaped our lives<br>
Leading us into an unmarked grave<br>
In moments life could end<br>
So I will speak while I can<br><br>

This is my chance<br>
My time to stand<br>

We may fail alone but that is better<br>
Than dying with them only to be forgotten<br>
I for one would rather suffer now<br>
Than leave this life without passion<br><br>

This is our chance<br>
Our time to stand

"Truth" that sounds right to our ears<br><br>

But what wisdom is there within us<br>
To live based on the feeling of our hearts<br>
How many times has instinct let us down<br>
Never to be thought through<br>
Never to be questioned<br>
Say what you really mean<br>
When your ambition calls you<br>
For what use is there in praying<br>
If you will only hear what you want to hear?<br><br>

We speak of fighting to resist this world<br>
But what about the battle within us?<br>
If we have chosen to live against the grain<br>
Then why are we all facing the same way?<br>
There is no difference between us and them<br>
If we all blindly seek truth from sentiments

So there will be time for us to be redeemed<br>
But surely wrath is not being held out<br>
So that we may redeem ourselves<br>
For I've seen the madness<br><br>
Of those who died trying<br>
But is regret only a word that the living possess?<br>
I long to see their faces<br>
Regardless of the decay<br>
For in the eyes of the deceased...<br><br>

We would see hope in our last day<br>
Inside this dying world<br>
For there is still beauty<br>
Inside this dying world

I am no one's hero<br>
For we are not the giant men<br>
That some may think<br>
You are faithful when we are not<br>
So I'd like to tell this story<br>
The way it is meant to be<br><br>
Without the burden that's in our hearts<br>
None of us would have ever found You<br>
For You are faithful when we are not<br>
You began a work<br>
That only you can complete<br><br>

Now this is who we are<br>
I'll never know the answers<br>
And I'll always wonder why<br><br>

...Why we're given grace we'll never deserve<br>
And a second chance that we will never earn<br>
For there is nothing I can do to save myself<br><br>

Now this is who we are<br>
I'll never know the answers<br>
And I'll always wonder why<br>
But You have let me start again<br>
I'd rather be called weak<br>
Than die thinking I was strong

no matter how many times before I've failed.<br><br>

It seems our problems solve themselves when<br>

I have failed those who I love the most<br>
And in the process become aware<br><br>

I have accepted there is so much that I don't know<br>
I have accepted my limitations<br><br>

It is that knowledge that opens the door<br>
For greater understanding<br>
Perspective on what is still untold<br><br>

I have accepted there is so much that I don't know<br>
I have accepted my limitations<br>
I have accepted there is so much that I'll never know<br>
I have accepted my limitations<br><br>

Sorting out my thoughts, that is why I write<br>
Though I reveal my weakness surrendering is remedy<br>
These songs have helped me though my greatest pain<br>
Unwound within me the disorder of my life<br>

I now see things for how they are<br>
Even if that is a harsh reality<br><br>

I have accepted there is so much that I don't know<br>
I have accepted my limitations<br>
I have accepted there is so much that I'll never know<br>
I have accepted my limitations</p>

      <h1 id="ff13" class="lyrics-test">-A Greater Foundation (Extended Demo Version)-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">Reality no longer battles perception.<br>
This letter's written to no one.<br><br>

Sincere,<br>
I sought your truth and divine purpose through myths of revelation.<br>
Guidance all wrapped up in a paper box,<br>
Supported only so long, as my mind was the enemy.<br>
Until I could not in good conscience hold on.<br><br>

You call this shameful disbelief,<br>
A process like losing my closest friend.<br><br>

AS WE face distress WE MUST not lose heart.<br>
STAND FAST and press on,<br>
TRIUMPH AWAITS<br>
AS WE face distress WE MUST not lose heart.<br>
STAND FAST and press on,<br>
TRIUMPH AWAITS us<br><br>

The powerful constant that I had once leaned on is no longer there (no longer)<br>
But no matter how sincere my devotion<br>
The pieces never fit.<br><br>

AS WE face distress WE MUST not lose heart.<br>
STAND FAST and press on,<br>
TRIUMPH AWAITS<br>
AS WE face distress WE MUST not lose heart.<br>
STAND FAST and press on,<br>
TRIUMPH AWAITS us<br><br>

Sometimes we have to watch our whole lives fall apart,<br>
Before we can rebuild them again - a greater foundation.<br>
(We watch our whole lives)<br>
Sometimes we have to watch our whole lives<br>
(Fall apart)<br>
Before we can rebuild them again<br>
(We build them again)<br>
A greater foundation<br><br>

I wish there was another way,<br>
[x5]<br>
Triumph awaits!<br>

Sometimes we have to watch our whole lives fall apart,<br>
Before we can rebuild them again - a greater foundation.<br>
(We watch our whole lives)<br>
Sometimes we have to watch our whole lives<br>
(Fall apart)<br>
Before we can rebuild them again<br>
(We build them again)<br>
A greater foundation</p>

      <h1 id="fff1" class="lyrics-test">-My Own Grave-</h1>
      <p class="lyrics-test-test">(The lies, the weight, deceit, decay)<br>
The lies, the weight<br>
It's clear I lost my way<br>
Deceit, decay<br>
(Decomposing)<br><br>

I thought I was an architect but I was just moving dirt<br>
Stacking mud over malice covered-up forming nothing but a pile of hurt<br>
I hadn’t been building (Building)<br>
The time was spent digging (Digging)<br>
Boring the barriers that kept others away (Away)<br>
The deeper the walls, the less anyone could hear (Hear me) fall<br><br>

So now I know there is no one else to blame<br><br>

Buried alive inside of my own grave<br>
And there's no one else to blame<br>
Buried alive inside of my own grave<br>
Inside of my own grave<br><br>

Beneath my lies<br>
Delusional enough to think I’d designed something great<br>
Like a giant headstone inscribed to describe my shameful fate<br>
I hadn't been building (Building)<br>
The time was spent digging (Digging)<br>
An ugly truth from which there was no way to escape (Escape)<br>
Nowhere left to hide and then finally forced to face what I'd become<br><br>

Buried alive inside of my own grave (My grave)<br>
And there's no one else to blame<br>
Buried alive inside of my own grave (My grave)<br>
What I'd become<br>
Buried alive inside of my own grave<br><br>

Beneath my pride crushing me<br>
Beneath my lies collapsing<br>
(But we are still alive)<br>
We are still alive<br><br>

Buried alive inside of my own grave<br>
And there's no one else to blame<br>
Buried alive inside of my own grave<br>
My own grave<br><br>

Buried alive inside of my own grave<br>
And there's no one else to blame<br>
The lies and the weight, I know I lost my way (My way)<br>
What I'd become<br>
Buried alive inside of my own grave (My grave)<br>
And there's no one else to blame<br>
Buried alive, buried alive<br><br>

Finally forced to face what I'd become<br>
What I'd become<br>
(In my own grave)<br>
Buried<br>
(In my own grave)<br>
Alive</p>
